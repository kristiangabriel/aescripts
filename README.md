# 🎬 Kristian Gabriel – AE Scripts & Expressions Handbook
Welcome to your central library of After Effects expressions and micro-training modules. My name is Kristian Gabriel, Creative Director,Graphic & Motion Design Artist, and other things they haven't defined yet. LOL. The following is a WORK IN PROGRESS and something I wish I would have had when I was learning After Effects. Once again, this is a work in progress and there are definitely issues and errors. Please bring them to my attention and I would be happy to fix them. I fully acknowledge that every motion designer will do and code things differently and thats okay! At the end of the day its about all of us getting our work done and meeting those deadlines. I have information, you have information, we all have information and between...hopefully all this can help those who need it. Anyways! Each category includes explanations, examples, and professional shortcuts for motion design, rigging, and automation. Hope you have fun and enjoy!

## 🧠 Introduction to After Effects Expressions

## What Are Expressions?

Expressions are **tiny bits of code that control animation** inside After Effects.  
Instead of adding dozens of keyframes, you can describe how something behaves using a simple line or two of logic.

At their core, expressions tell a property *how* to change over time.  
They’re written in a scripting language **based on JavaScript**—but simplified and tailored for motion graphics.  
You don’t need to be a programmer.  
You just need to understand a few patterns: how to refer to a value, do basic math, and connect one property to another.

When you write an expression, you’re not replacing animation skills—you’re *enhancing* them.  
Expressions automate repetitive actions, create natural physics, link layers together, and let you explore creative motion that would take hours to keyframe manually.

---

## The Big Difference: Keyframes vs. Expressions

| Concept | Keyframes | Expressions |
|----------|------------|-------------|
| How it works | You set values at specific frames and AE interpolates between them. | You describe a rule or relationship; AE calculates values automatically each frame. |
| Example | Scale 0% → 100% over 1 second | `value + 10*Math.sin(time*2*Math.PI)` |
| Flexibility | Static — must be updated by hand. | Dynamic — updates automatically, even if timing changes. |

You can even *mix* them.  
Add keyframes first, then apply an expression on top to enhance the motion—AE simply layers the math over your keyframed base value.

---

## You Don’t Need to Know Full JavaScript

After Effects expressions use **a limited, friendly subset of JavaScript** called *ExtendScript Expressions*.  
It’s purpose-built for artists, not developers.  
Here’s the good news:

- You’ll **never** write full web-style JavaScript with functions, objects, and DOM calls.  
- You’ll mainly use small formulas—often one or two lines.  
- AE gives you built-in variables like `time`, `value`, `thisComp`, and helper functions like `wiggle()`, `linear()`, and `ease()`.

Think of it like learning to drive a car without becoming a mechanic.  
You’ll use the controls, not build the engine.

---

## Where Expressions Live

Every property that can be keyframed (Position, Scale, Opacity, Rotation, etc.) can also hold an expression.

1. **Alt-click (Windows)** or **Option-click (Mac)** the stopwatch icon next to the property.  
2. A small text field appears below it.  
3. Type or paste your expression.  
4. Press **Enter** (numpad) or **Return** to apply it.

If the code is valid, AE displays it in red text and animates immediately.  
If there’s an error, you’ll see a warning with a description—often as simple as a missing semicolon or parenthesis.

---

## How Expressions Think

When AE reads your expression:
1. It looks at the property’s current value (that’s the special variable `value`).  
2. It evaluates your code **for every frame** of the timeline.  
3. It returns a new value to display.

So an expression is a *formula* continuously evaluated—like a live calculator for motion.

Example idea:
> “Every frame, move the layer 50 pixels above another layer.”

That’s one line:
```js
thisComp.layer("Hero").transform.position - [0,50]
```

## 🎬 Core Animation

### Why Core Animation Matters
Core Animation is where expressions come alive.  
If the Introduction taught you *what* expressions are and *why* they exist, this section teaches you *how they shape motion itself.*

At its heart, animation is storytelling through movement.  
Expressions give that movement intelligence—turning static transitions into living, responsive motion. They let you describe *how* something should behave, not just *where* it should go. Whether it’s a bouncing logo, a button reacting to touch, or a swarm of layers cascading in rhythm, Core Animation builds the foundation for believable energy and timing.

Think of it as your first step into **expressive motion logic**: how to make After Effects understand physics, weight, anticipation, and reaction—all through a few lines of math and relationships between layers.

---

### The Mental Model
Before diving into code, it’s important to understand *how animators think when they use expressions*.

- **Keyframes define intention.**  
  They say, “Move from here to there.”  

- **Expressions define behavior.**  
  They say, “Move like this.”

Instead of manually animating every easing curve or bounce, you describe a motion rule—something like:
> “Every time this object lands, give it a little spring.”

That rule can apply to one layer or a hundred layers simultaneously.  
Core Animation is where that shift happens—from keyframe-by-keyframe design to *systemic animation thinking.*

---

### Quick Setup: Building a Safe Playground
Before any advanced work, it helps to build a quick testing setup:
1. **Create a Null layer** named `CTRL`.  
2. Add a few **Expression Controls → Slider Controls** and rename them “Amp,” “Freq,” and “Decay.”  
3. These act as universal dials to adjust the intensity, speed, and smoothness of any animation later.

You’re not writing code yet—you’re preparing your environment.  
These sliders become your “motion DNA”—a way to control how energy travels through your scene.

---

### The Philosophy of Core Motion
Every great animation—no matter how complex—comes down to a few timeless principles:
- **Anticipation**: the small pre-movement before an action.  
- **Overshoot**: the satisfying rebound after reaching a destination.  
- **Follow-Through**: parts of an object continuing to move after the main body stops.  
- **Delay and Offset**: staggered timing to create natural flow.  
- **Loops and Repetition**: energy that feels continuous, alive, rhythmic.  

Expressions don’t replace these principles—they **amplify** them.  
By describing them mathematically, you can repeat and control them endlessly without manually adjusting keyframes.

---

### Where You’re Headed Next
In the coming Core Animation modules, we’ll translate these ideas into action:
- How to build an elastic overshoot with a few lines of math.  
- How to make objects react with follow-through automatically.  
- How to offset animations so entire compositions flow together.  
- And how to loop or oscillate motion for dynamic, self-sustaining energy.

You’ll start small—just sliders and shapes—and end up creating motion systems that behave like living organisms.

> The goal isn’t to memorize code.  
> It’s to learn to think like motion behaves.

Once you’ve built this foundation, everything else—Text Animation, Physics, Rigging—builds effortlessly on top.

<a id="core-animation-part-ii"></a>
## 🎬 Core Animation – Part II: Practical Motion Recipes
This is your hands-on module. Each recipe explains what it does, where to apply it, how to set it up, and how to tune it.

### 🪄 Prerequisites (one-time rig)
Create a Null named **CTRL** and add three *Slider Controls* (Amp, Freq, Decay). Then use them in any expression:

```js
ctrl=thisComp.layer("CTRL");
amp =ctrl.effect("Amp")("Slider");
freq=ctrl.effect("Freq")("Slider");
decay=ctrl.effect("Decay")("Slider");

```
Suggested starting values: Amp **30**, Freq **3**, Decay **4**.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### 1) Elastic Overshoot — consistent rebound
**What it does:** Adds a springy rebound as the layer comes to rest (same size every time).  
**When to use:** Logo pop-ins, buttons releasing, icons landing.  
**Where:** Scale, Position, or Rotation of the animated layer.

**How to set up (quick):**
1) Keyframe your base move (optional, but looks best).
2) Paste the expression on the target property.

**Expression:**
```js
t=time-inPoint;
value + amp*Math.sin(freq*t*2*Math.PI)*Math.exp(-decay*t);
```

**Tune:** Higher **Decay** = quicker settle; higher **Freq** = tighter bounce; lower **Amp** = subtler.  
**Example workflow:** Animate Scale 0%→100% in 12f. Amp 25, Freq 3.5, Decay 5 for a tidy logo pop.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### 2) Elastic Overshoot — velocity-based (reactive)
**What it does:** Overshoot size responds to the actual **arrival speed** at the last keyframe.  
**When to use:** Physical UI, character hits, panels that slam vs. drift.  
**Where:** Any **keyframed** property.

**How to set up:**
1) Animate your layer to a key pose.
2) Paste the expression on that property.

**Expression:**
```js
// normalize CTRL sliders for velocity use
amp  = amp/200;
freq = freq/30;
decay= decay/10;

n=(numKeys>0)?nearestKey(time).index:0;
if(n && key(n).time>time) n--;
if(n>0){
  t=time-key(n).time;
  v=velocityAtTime(key(n).time - thisComp.frameDuration/10);
  value + v*amp*Math.sin(freq*t*2*Math.PI)*Math.exp(-decay*t);
}else{
  value;
}
```

**Tune:** If it “snaps” at the key, increase the sample offset to `thisComp.frameDuration/5`.  
**Example workflow:** Big panel flies in, smaller card glides in. Same expression → panel overshoots more because it’s faster.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### 3) Delay Chain — “follow the leader”
**What it does:** Duplicates trail a leader with a per-layer time offset (beautiful cascades).  
**When to use:** Stacks of cards, ribbons, list reveals, dot trails.  
**Where:** Followers’ Position/Rotation/Scale.

**How to set up:**
1) Name your lead layer **Leader**.
2) Duplicate your follower layers.
3) Paste on followers’ animated property.

**Expression:**
```js
leader=thisComp.layer("Leader");
delayPerLayer=0.05; // seconds between indices
lag=(thisLayer.index - leader.index) * delayPerLayer;
valueAtTime(time - lag);
```

**Tune:** Smaller **delayPerLayer** = tighter wave; larger = more laggy flow.  
**Example workflow:** Animate Position on Leader only → duplicate 8x → instant cascading reveal.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### 4) Anticipation — pre-motion nudge
**What it does:** Tiny “wind-up” before motion that clarifies intent and adds snap.  
**When to use:** Characters, cursors, buttons about to move.  
**Where:** Position.

**How to set up:** Paste on the moving layer’s Position (works with or without additional keys).

**Expression:**
```js
lead=0.06;          // seconds of look-ahead
nudge=[-20,0];      // oppose main move (example: going right → nudge left)
t=time + lead;
valueAtTime(t) + nudge*Math.exp(-t*10);
```

**Tune:** Shorter **lead** = snappier cue; adjust **nudge** direction/amount for taste.  
**Example workflow:** Button grows on hover → add a tiny left nudge before its rightward slide.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### 5) Follow-Through — secondary settle
**What it does:** Child parts trail and settle after the body stops (inertia).  
**When to use:** Flags, pointers, accents, limbs.  
**Where:** Rotation or Position of the *trailing* piece.

**How to set up:** Parent the trailing piece to the main object. Paste on the trailer.

**Expression:**
```js
lag = 0.08;  // how far behind
damp= 6;     // higher = crisper stop
base = valueAtTime(time - lag);
delta= value - base;
base + delta*Math.exp(-damp*lag);
```

**Tune:** Increase **lag** for softer drag; increase **damp** for a quicker stop.  
**Example workflow:** A pointer arrow rotates; its tail cap follows with lag for lively overlap.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### 6) Bounce & Drop — gravity + energy loss
**What it does:** Simulates vertical drop with diminishing bounces.  
**When to use:** Dropping icons, chips, badges.  
**Where:** Position (Y).

**How to set up:** Paste on Position and set `floorY` to your ground.

**Expression:**
```js
g=1800;          // gravity
b=0.45;          // bounciness (0..1)
floorY=900;      // ground Y

t=time - inPoint;
y=value[1] + g*t*t/2;

if (y>floorY){
  t = Math.sqrt(2*(y-floorY)/g);
  v = g*t*(1-b);
  y = floorY - v*v/(2*g);
}
[value[0], y];
```

**Tune:** Lower **b** = flatter, higher **b** = rubberier. Adjust **floorY** to your comp.  
**Example workflow:** Badge drops into frame, hits “ground,” then settles with two quick diminishing bounces.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### 7) Squash & Stretch — speed-aware (smoothed)
**What it does:** Deforms Scale based on **motion speed**, smoothed to avoid jitter; returns to 100% at rest.  
**When to use:** Bouncy UI chips, balls, stickers; character motion.  
**Where:** Scale.

**How to set up (self-driven):** Layer (or its parent) must actually move.

**Expression (self-driven):**
```js
maxSquash=22; normSpeed=800; smoothWin=0.10; samples=5;
dt=thisComp.frameDuration;

function spdAt(t){
  p1=transform.position.valueAtTime(t);
  p0=transform.position.valueAtTime(t - dt);
  v=(p1-p0)/dt;
  return length(v);
}

sum=0;
for(i=0;i<samples;i++){
  tt=time - i*(smoothWin/Math.max(1,(samples-1)));
  sum+=spdAt(tt);
}
spd=sum/samples;

k = clamp(spd/normSpeed,0,1);
sx=100 + (maxSquash*k);
sy=100 - (maxSquash*k);
[sx,sy];
```

**Alternative (leader-driven):** Works even if this layer is static; follows a layer named “Leader”.
```js
leader=thisComp.layer("Leader");
maxSquash=22; normSpeed=800; smoothWin=0.10; samples=5;
dt=thisComp.frameDuration;

function spdAt(t){
  p1=leader.transform.position.valueAtTime(t);
  p0=leader.transform.position.valueAtTime(t - dt);
  v=(p1-p0)/dt;
  return length(v);
}

sum=0;
for(i=0;i<samples;i++){
  tt=time - i*(smoothWin/Math.max(1,(samples-1)));
  sum+=spdAt(tt);
}
spd=sum/samples;

k = clamp(spd/normSpeed,0,1);
sx=100 + (maxSquash*k);
sy=100 - (maxSquash*k);
[sx,sy];
```

**Optional add-on (Rotation → face travel direction):**
```js
dt=thisComp.frameDuration;
p1=transform.position;
p0=transform.position.valueAtTime(time-dt);
v=p1-p0; spd=length(v);
(spd>0.1)?radiansToDegrees(Math.atan2(v[1],v[0])):value;
```

**Tune:** Lower **maxSquash** for subtlety; raise **normSpeed** if your motion is fast; increase **smoothWin/samples** to calm jitter.  
**Example workflow:** Ball moves across screen (Position keys). S&S on Scale delivers lively stretch on fast parts, subtle squash on slowdowns, and returns to 100% when still.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### 8) Loops & Oscillation — perpetual motion
**What it does:** Keeps motion alive either from keyframes (ping-pong) or pure math (oscillator).  
**When to use:** Breathing icons, pulsing lights, pendulums.  
**Where:** Any property.

**How to set up:** Paste one of the following.

**Ping-pong existing keys:**
```js
loopOut("pingpong");
```

**Time-based oscillator (no keys):**
```js
amp=15; freq=1.2;
value + amp*Math.sin(freq*time*2*Math.PI);
```

**Tune:** Use small **amp** for tasteful “alive” motion.  
**Example workflow:** Two keyframes on Rotation for a small swing → `loopOut("pingpong")` → endless pendulum.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### 9) Marker-Triggered Pop — manual beats/cues
**What it does:** Fires a quick bounce exactly on your **layer markers**.  
**When to use:** Musical hits, UI pips, timed pulses.  
**Where:** Scale or Opacity.

**How to set up:**
1) Add markers (`*` shortcut) where hits should happen.
2) Paste on the property.

**Expression:**
```js
n=0;
if(marker.numKeys>0){
  n=marker.nearestKey(time).index;
  if(marker.key(n).time>time) n--;
}
if(n>0){
  t=time - marker.key(n).time;
  value + 30*Math.sin(6*t*2*Math.PI)*Math.exp(-5*t);
}else{
  value;
}
```

**Tune:** Adjust the `30`, `6`, and `5` trinity (amplitude, frequency, decay) to fit your track.  
**Example workflow:** Place markers on kick hits; Scale pulses perfectly in sync.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### 🔧 Troubleshooting (quick)
• Nothing happens → confirm layer names (`CTRL`, `Leader`), property target, and that the object (or leader) actually moves.  
• Too wild → lower **Amp**, raise **Decay**, reduce **Freq**.  
• Velocity overshoot snaps → increase the sample offset (`frameDuration/5`).  
• Followers misaligned → positive `delayPerLayer`, correct leader index.  
• S&S does nothing → ensure motion or use the leader-driven variant.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Next → **Text & Type**: apply these same motion principles to typography (per-character delays, overshoots, and rhythm).


<a id="text-and-type"></a>
## 🔠 Text & Type — Practical Motion Recipes
This is your typography lab. Each recipe below includes full explanations, step-by-step setup, tuning tips, and real-world usage.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### 🧭 Working with Text Expressions
Text layers have two main areas for expressions:

• **Source Text**  →  changes the text itself (typewriter, counters, scrambles).  
• **Animators + Expression Selector**  →  controls per-character/word/line transforms (opacity, scale, position, color).

Basic rule:  *Source Text* = modify content.  
*Animators* = modify motion/look per character.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### 1) Typewriter — character by character
**What it does:** reveals letters one at a time, like live typing.  
**Where:** on **Source Text**.  
**How:**
1. Type your full sentence.  
2. Alt/Option-click Source Text stopwatch.  
3. Paste the code below.

```js
speed=12;                          // characters per second
s=value.toString();
n=Math.floor((time-inPoint)*speed);
n=clamp(n,0,s.length);
s.substr(0,n);
```
**Optional cursor:**  
```js
speed=12;
cursorOn=Math.sin(time*8)>0;
s=value.toString();
n=Math.floor((time-inPoint)*speed);
n=clamp(n,0,s.length);
s.substr(0,n)+(cursorOn?"|":"");
```
**Tune:** adjust **speed**.  
**Example:**  dialogue bubbles, console text, subtitles.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### 2) Typewriter — word by word
**What it does:** reveals full words sequentially.  
**Where:** **Source Text**.

```js
delay=0.20;                         // seconds per word
words=value.toString().split(" ");
count=Math.floor((time-inPoint)/delay);
count=clamp(count,0,words.length);
words.slice(0,count).join(" ");
```
**Use:** taglines, lyric subtitles, timed quotes.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### 3) Character Cascade — fade/slide reveal
**What it does:** each character (or word/line) appears with offset timing and motion.  
**Where:** in a **Text Animator** with *Opacity 0%* and optional *Position [0,20]*.  
Add an **Expression Selector** and paste on **Amount**.

```js
delay=0.03;rise=0.15;
t=time-inPoint-(textIndex-1)*delay;
ease(t,0,rise,0,100);
```
**Tune:** delay = spacing, rise = duration.  
**Example:** kinetic subtitles, lyric reveals, info lists.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### 4) Elastic Overshoot per Character
**What it does:** each character pops in with a bounce.  
**Where:** Text Animator → Scale (+40,+40) → Expression Selector → Amount.

```js
delay=0.035;amp=60;freq=5;decay=6;
t=time-inPoint-(textIndex-1)*delay;
kick=amp*Math.sin(freq*t*2*Math.PI)*Math.exp(-decay*t);
clamp(kick,0,100);
```
**Tune:**  
• amp → strength  
• freq → bounces  
• decay → settle speed  
**Example:** energetic headlines, emoji pops, promo titles.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### 5) Word / Line Stagger (reusable)
**What it does:** same cascade logic, usable for Characters, Words, or Lines depending on “Based On.”  
**Where:** any Text Animator → Expression Selector → Amount.

```js
delay=0.08;dur=0.18;
t=time-inPoint-(textIndex-1)*delay;
ease(t,0,dur,0,100);
```
Switch **Based On** to Words or Lines as needed.  
**Example:** multiline intros, caption slides.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### 6) Random Scramble → Resolve
**What it does:** scrambles characters then resolves to the final text.  
**Where:** **Source Text**.

```js
charset="ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789";
stepDur=0.05;
txt=value.toString();
elapsed=Math.max(0,time-inPoint);
revealCount=Math.floor(elapsed/stepDur);
out="";
for(i=0;i<txt.length;i++){
 if(i<revealCount) out+=txt[i];
 else if(txt[i]==" ") out+=" ";
 else{
  seedRandom(i+Math.floor(time*20),true);
  out+=charset[Math.floor(random(charset.length))];
 }
}
out;
```
**Tune:** smaller stepDur = faster resolve.  
**Example:** HUDs, sci-fi titles, digital counters.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### 7) Numeric Counter
**What it does:** counts from start → end smoothly.  
**Where:** **Source Text**.

```js
start=0;end=1000;
t0=inPoint;t1=inPoint+2;
decimals=0;
v=linear(time,t0,t1,start,end);
v=(time<t0)?start:(time>t1)?end:v;
prefix="";suffix="";
formatted=decimals>0?v.toFixed(decimals):Math.round(v).toString();
prefix+formatted+suffix;
```
**Example:** progress %, dollar totals, milliseconds.  
Change prefix/suffix for units or currency.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### 8) Slide-Up + Fade
**What it does:** each character slides upward and fades in.  
**Where:** Text Animator with *Position [0,20]* and *Opacity 0%*, Expression Selector → Amount.

```js
delay=0.025;dur=0.12;
t=time-inPoint-(textIndex-1)*delay;
ease(t,0,dur,0,100);
```
**Example:** modern UI titles, app onboarding text, credits.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### 9) Color Pulse Accent
**What it does:** adds a brief color pulse as text reveals.  
**Where:** Text Animator → Fill Color RGB → Expression Selector → Amount.

```js
delay=0.03;dur=0.10;overshoot=120;
t=time-inPoint-(textIndex-1)*delay;
val=ease(t,0,dur,0,100);
(Math.abs(Math.sin(t*6))>0.9)?overshoot:val;
```
**Tip:** keep overshoot ≤120 for subtle shimmer.  
**Example:** highlight key words, lyric beats.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### 🔧 Troubleshooting
• Nothing happens → confirm you’re on the correct property (Source Text vs. Expression Selector Amount).  
• All text appears instantly → check “Based On” in selector.  
• Timing off → tweak delay/dur.  
• Scramble unreadable → shorten stepDur.  
• Counter jumps → adjust t0/t1 and decimals.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### 🧪 Quick Exercises
1. Create a typewriter headline with a blinking cursor.  
2. Add a slide-up cascade reveal (delay 0.02 s).  
3. Combine elastic overshoot with color pulse for a lively promo title.  
4. Make a numeric counter showing $0 → $999 over 3 s.  
5. Try a scramble→resolve effect for a “SYSTEM ONLINE” text.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Next → **Motion & Physics:** explore realistic drifts, inertia, and simulated forces for both text and graphics.


<a id="motion-and-physics"></a>
## 🌪️ Motion & Physics — Practical Motion Recipes
This section explores motion that feels *real* — with momentum, drag, gravity, friction, and follow-through.  
You’ll learn how to add inertia to any property, simulate floating drift, create gravitational pull, and add realistic damped spring motion.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### 🧭 Quick Note on Approach
All “physics” here are simplified — they use **expressions**, not simulations.  
You can paste these directly on Position, Rotation, or custom properties.  
They’re designed to feel *cinematic* and responsive without needing plugins.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### 1) Inertia / Momentum
**What it does:** continues motion naturally after the keyframes stop, gradually slowing down.  
**Where:** any keyframed property (Position, Rotation, Scale).

**How to set up:**
1. Animate your layer as usual (ending keyframes).  
2. Paste this on the animated property.

```js
n = 0;
if (numKeys > 0){
  n = nearestKey(time).index;
  if (key(n).time > time) n--;
}
if (n == 0){
  value;
}else{
  t = time - key(n).time;
  v = velocityAtTime(key(n).time - thisComp.frameDuration/10);
  amp = .85;    // momentum strength
  decay = 4;    // drag (higher = stops faster)
  value + v*amp*Math.exp(-decay*t);
}
```

**Tune:**  
- Lower `decay` for slower, gliding stops.  
- Raise `amp` for more momentum.  
**Example:** Camera drift after stop, UI panel easing to rest.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### 2) Floating Drift / Ambient Motion
**What it does:** continuous slow, smooth random drift for background elements.  
**Where:** Position or Rotation.

```js
amp = [20,10];   // movement amplitude X,Y
freq = 0.08;     // cycles per second
seedRandom(index,true);
[sin(time*freq*2*Math.PI)*amp[0],
 cos(time*freq*2*Math.PI)*amp[1]]
```

**Tune:**  
- Lower `freq` for slower motion.  
- Adjust amplitude for subtle or large sway.  
**Example:** Floating HUD panels, hovering icons, parallax layers.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### 3) Friction (Progressive Resistance)
**What it does:** simulates gradual deceleration over time — like air resistance.  
**Where:** any continuously animated property.

```js
vel = velocity;       // built-in velocity at this frame
fric = 0.85;          // 0–1 range (lower = more resistance)
value - vel*(1-fric);
```

**Tip:** combine with looped or oscillating animation for more natural slowing.  
**Example:** mechanical dials, rotating wheels, swinging pointers.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### 4) Spring Physics (Hooke’s Law)
**What it does:** creates a spring that pulls toward a target value with realistic bounce.  
**Where:** Position, Scale, or Rotation.

```js
target = thisComp.layer("CTRL").transform.position; // or any target
stiffness = 5;    // higher = stiffer spring
damping   = 1.5;  // higher = more damped
mass      = 1;

t = time - inPoint;
x = value - target;
accel = (-stiffness/mass)*x - damping*velocity/mass;
value + accel;
```

**Tune:**  
- Lower `damping` = bouncier.  
- Higher `stiffness` = tighter spring.  
**Example:** camera rig sway, UI follow, connected elements.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### 5) Gravity Drop
**What it does:** simulates a simple fall under gravity with optional bounce.  
**Where:** Position (Y-axis typically).

```js
g = 1200;        // gravity
b = 0.6;         // bounce coefficient (0–1)
floor = 800;     // ground Y
t = time - inPoint;
y = value[1] + g*t*t/2;
if (y > floor){
  t = Math.sqrt(2*(y-floor)/g);
  v = g*t*(1-b);
  y = floor - v*v/(2*g);
}
[value[0], y];
```

**Tune:**  
- Lower `b` for flatter bounces.  
- Adjust `floor` for comp height.  
**Example:** falling logo, icon drop-in, physics toys.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### 6) Orbit / Centripetal Force
**What it does:** keeps a layer orbiting another layer’s position in circular motion.  
**Where:** Position.

```js
center = thisComp.layer("CENTER").transform.position;
radius = 200;
speed  = 1.2;       // rotations per second
angle  = time*speed*2*Math.PI;
[center[0] + Math.cos(angle)*radius,
 center[1] + Math.sin(angle)*radius];
```

**Tip:** animate `radius` or `speed` for dynamic orbits.  
**Example:** spinning satellites, atomic diagrams, UI radar sweeps.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### 7) Follow / Chase (Smooth Target Tracking)
**What it does:** makes a layer follow another with lag and smoothing.  
**Where:** Position.

```js
leader = thisComp.layer("Leader");
lag = 0.25;         // seconds of delay
follow = leader.transform.position.valueAtTime(time - lag);
damp = 8;           // damping for extra smoothness
linear(value, follow, follow, follow, value + (follow - value)/damp);
```

**Example:** camera follow shots, trailing icons, soft object pursuit.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### 8) Pendulum Swing
**What it does:** oscillating rotation like a pendulum with natural decay.  
**Where:** Rotation.

```js
amp = 45;      // degrees
freq = 0.5;    // swings per second
decay = 0.8;   // exponential damping
amp*Math.sin(freq*time*2*Math.PI)/Math.exp(decay*time);
```

**Tune:**  
- Smaller `decay` = longer swing.  
- Higher `amp` = wider swing.  
**Example:** hanging signs, character tails, swinging lamps.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### 9) Dampened Oscillator (Universal Bounce)
**What it does:** reusable “bounce physics” for any property.  
**Where:** any keyframed property.

```js
amp = .6; freq = 3; decay = 5;
n = 0;
if (numKeys > 0){
  n = nearestKey(time).index;
  if (key(n).time > time) n--;
}
if (n == 0){ value; }
else {
  t = time - key(n).time;
  v = velocityAtTime(key(n).time - thisComp.frameDuration/10);
  value + v*amp*Math.sin(freq*t*2*Math.PI)/Math.exp(decay*t);
}
```

**Tune:**  
- `amp` controls strength, `freq` speed, `decay` damping.  
**Example:** universal “spring-back” for sliders, panels, or limbs.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### 🔧 Troubleshooting
• Nothing moves → ensure layer has keyframes or target reference.  
• Too fast → reduce `freq` or increase `decay`.  
• Motion drifts offscreen → check comp units (pixels vs 3D space).  
• For linked layers, verify target layer names match exactly.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### 🧪 Practice Exercises
1. Apply *Inertia* to a logo’s Position so it drifts after stop.  
2. Create a *Floating Drift* background using slow sine motion.  
3. Add *Gravity Drop* to icons that bounce onto a floor line.  
4. Combine *Follow/Chase* + *Spring Physics* for a soft camera rig.  
5. Build a *Pendulum Swing* title and gradually increase `decay` until it rests.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Next → **Controllers & Rigging**: learn to centralize multiple physics expressions under shared sliders and layer controls.


<a id="controllers-and-rigging"></a>
## 🎛️ Controllers & Rigging — Practical Motion Recipes
Centralize control of many layers, create reusable UI (**sliders, checkboxes, angles, colors, points**), and build lightweight rigs (stagger systems, look-at targets, simple 2-bone IK, state blends, and global timing). This chapter gives you repeatable patterns that scale from one layer to an entire sequence.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### 🧭 Controller Philosophy
- **One place to art-direct:** a single CTRL layer drives many dependent expressions.
- **Non-destructive:** keyframe the child layers as usual; controllers *add* behavior.
- **Name discipline wins:** consistent effect names prevent broken pickwhips.

**Recommended controller layer**
- Add a **Null** named **CTRL**.
- Add the following controls (Effects > Expression Controls):
  - Slider: **Amp**, **Freq**, **Decay** (motion DNA, reused everywhere)
  - Slider: **Global Delay**, **Global Speed**
  - Checkbox: **Enable Rig**
  - Angle Control: **Aim**
  - Color Control: **Primary Color**
  - Point Control: **Target**
  
You’ll reference controls like:
```js
C = thisComp.layer("CTRL");
amp   = C.effect("Amp")("Slider");
freq  = C.effect("Freq")("Slider");
decay = C.effect("Decay")("Slider");
```

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### 1) Master On/Off (safety switch)
**What it does:** cleanly gates an expression so you can toggle a rig globally.

**Where:** paste on any driven property (Position/Scale/Rotation/Opacity).

```js
C = thisComp.layer("CTRL");
on = C.effect("Enable Rig")("Checkbox") > 0;
on ? value : valueAtTime(time); // same value, but no added behavior when off
```

**Tip:** Use this at the top of “spicy” expressions. Flip one checkbox to compare rigged vs. vanilla motion.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### 2) Global Amplitude / Timing (central art direction)
**What it does:** lets **Amp / Freq / Decay** act as global dials across your comp.

**Where:** wrap existing bounce/elastic snippets with globals.

```js
C=thisComp.layer("CTRL");
A=C.effect("Amp")("Slider");
F=C.effect("Freq")("Slider");
D=C.effect("Decay")("Slider");

t=time - inPoint;
value + A*Math.sin(F*t*2*Math.PI)*Math.exp(-D*t);
```

**Use:** tweak three numbers to retime a whole sequence without touching child layers.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### 3) Global Stagger (delay everything from one slider)
**What it does:** offset many layers by a controllable delay.

**Where:** paste on any animated property of followers.

```js
C=thisComp.layer("CTRL");
dPer = C.effect("Global Delay")("Slider")/100; // seconds per index
lag  = (thisLayer.index - 1) * dPer;
valueAtTime(time - lag);
```

**Tip:** Duplicate layers, reorder to re-sequence the wave. The slider changes flow in one move.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### 4) Marker-Driven Stepper (choreograph beats from the controller)
**What it does:** uses **CTRL layer markers** as global timing cues for all children.

**Setup:** add markers on **CTRL** where hits should land.  
**Where:** paste on children’s properties.

```js
C = thisComp.layer("CTRL");
n = 0;
if (C.marker.numKeys>0){
  n = C.marker.nearestKey(time).index;
  if (C.marker.key(n).time > time) n--;
}
if (n>0){
  t=time - C.marker.key(n).time;
  // simple pop; swap your favorite hit here
  value + [0,0] + (10*Math.sin(6*t*2*Math.PI)*Math.exp(-5*t));
}else{
  value
}
```

**Use:** edit one marker track → entire comp reacts.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### 5) Index-Aware Rig (smart variations with one expression)
**What it does:** gives each duplicate its own offset/scale based on **layer index** and a single controller slider.

```js
C=thisComp.layer("CTRL");
spread = C.effect("Global Delay")("Slider")/100; // seconds
seedRandom(index, true);
perLayer = (index-1) * spread;
valueAtTime(time - perLayer);
```

**Use:** cards, dots, list items—one expression scales to N layers.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### 6) Look-At (2D target aiming)
**What it does:** rotate a layer to face a **Target** point on CTRL.

**Setup:** on **CTRL**, set a **Point Control** named **Target**.  
**Where:** paste on **Rotation** of the aiming layer.

```js
C=thisComp.layer("CTRL");
T=C.effect("Target")("Point");
p = toWorld(anchorPoint);
v = T - p;
radiansToDegrees(Math.atan2(v[1], v[0]));
```

**Extras:** add an **Aim** Angle Control to add/subtract an offset; clamp or damp for smoother aiming.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### 7) Follow with Lag + Damping (but controllable)
**What it does:** smooth follow of a moving **Target** point with time lag and damping.

**Where:** paste on **Position** of follower.

```js
C=thisComp.layer("CTRL");
T=C.effect("Target")("Point");
lag   = 0.18; // seconds
damp  = 8;    // higher = snappier
goal  = T;
base  = valueAtTime(time - lag);
base + (goal - base)/damp;
```

**Use:** soft camera rigs, secondary elements trailing primaries.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### 8) 2-Bone IK (simple 2D limb rig)
**What it does:** upper/lower bones rotate to reach a **Target** (law of cosines).  
**Setup:**
- Create 3 nulls: **Upper**, **Lower**, **Effector** (the end point to reach).
- Set **Upper** as parent of **Lower**; **Lower** parent of your hand/foot layer.
- On **CTRL**, reuse **Target** (Point Control) as the effector target.

**Paste on Upper ROTATION:**
```js
C=thisComp.layer("CTRL");
A=thisLayer;              // Upper
B=thisComp.layer("Lower");// Lower (child)
T=C.effect("Target")("Point");

a = A.toWorld(A.anchorPoint);
b = B.toWorld(B.anchorPoint);
t = T;

L1 = length(B.anchorPoint - A.anchorPoint); // approximate bone lengths in layer space
L2 = length(B.parent.transform.position);   // or set fixed numbers if preferred
d  = length(t - a);

d = clamp(d, Math.abs(L1-L2)+0.001, L1+L2-0.001); // triangle inequality

angA = Math.acos( (L1*L1 + d*d - L2*L2) / (2*L1*d) );
angAToTarget = Math.atan2((t - a)[1], (t - a)[0]);
radiansToDegrees(angAToTarget - angA);
```

**Paste on Lower ROTATION:**
```js
C=thisComp.layer("CTRL");
A=thisLayer.parent;   // Upper
B=thisLayer;          // Lower
T=C.effect("Target")("Point");

a = A.toWorld(A.anchorPoint);
b = B.toWorld(B.anchorPoint);
t = T;

L1 = length(B.anchorPoint - A.anchorPoint);
L2 = length(B.anchorPoint - B.toWorld(B.anchorPoint)); // fallback
d  = length(t - a);

d = clamp(d, Math.abs(L1-L2)+0.001, L1+L2-0.001);

angB = Math.acos( (L1*L1 + L2*L2 - d*d) / (2*L1*L2) );
- radiansToDegrees(Math.PI - angB);
```

**Notes:** AE layer spaces can vary by art; for production, measure L1/L2 once and hardcode. Add a **Pole** control (Point) to guide elbow direction if needed (by biasing angles toward pole).

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### 9) Slider-Driven State Blend (morph between two poses/timings)
**What it does:** blends between **State A** and **State B** using a single slider on CTRL.

**Setup:** on **CTRL**, add **Slider** named **State** (0–100).  
**Where:** paste on any numeric property you want to blend.

```js
C=thisComp.layer("CTRL");
S=C.effect("State")("Slider")/100; // 0..1

A = valueAtTime(inPoint + 0.0);  // pose/time A (can be keyframed time)
B = valueAtTime(inPoint + 0.5);  // pose/time B (or a different comp time)

linear(S, 0, 1, A, B);
```

**Use:** one slider morphs an icon from compact → expanded; or blends between two timing offsets.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### 10) Global Color Rig (palette from a single control)
**What it does:** all fills/strokes pick their color from **CTRL**.

**Where:** on shape/text **Fill Color** expression.

```js
C=thisComp.layer("CTRL");
C.effect("Primary Color")("Color");
```

**Use:** recolor an entire styleframe with one click.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### 11) Time-Remap Scrubber (controller as a timeline)
**What it does:** one slider scrubs a precomp’s animation.

**Setup:** precomp a clip, enable **Time-Remap** (Layer > Time > Enable Time Remapping).  
On **CTRL**, add **Slider** named **Playhead** (0–100).

**Paste on the precomp’s Time Remap:**
```js
C = thisComp.layer("CTRL");
S = C.effect("Playhead")("Slider");   // 0..100
t0 = 0; 
t1 = thisLayer.source.duration;       // full source range
linear(S, 0, 100, t0, t1);
```

**Use:** sequencer control, scrubbing a montage, quick A/B timing.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### 12) Comp-Wide Speed Control (slow-mo / time-crunch)
**What it does:** multiplies time for expressions globally.

**Setup:** on **CTRL**, add **Slider** named **Global Speed** (100 = normal).

**Pattern to use inside any expression:**
```js
C=thisComp.layer("CTRL");
speed = C.effect("Global Speed")("Slider")/100; // 0.5=half-speed, 2=double
t = inPoint + (time - inPoint)*speed;
// then use t instead of time:
valueAtTime(t);
```

**Use:** quickly slow everything down for review or ramp up for previews.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### 🔧 Troubleshooting
- **“Nothing changes”** → verify effect names on CTRL (case-sensitive) and target layer names (e.g., “CTRL”, “Leader”).  
- **“My rig fights keyframes”** → keep base keyframes minimal; let controllers add behavior, not replace every curve.  
- **“Angles flip”** → clamp inputs; avoid gimbal by staying in 2D for simple look-at and IK.  
- **“IK jitters”** → lock bone lengths (hardcode L1/L2), add a Pole bias, or slightly damp target motion.  
- **“Performance dips”** → reduce nested `valueAtTime` calls; centralize computations (cache CTRL variables at top).

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### 🧪 Practice Drills
1) Build a **Global Stagger** rig that offsets 12 cards—art-direct the wave from one slider.  
2) Create a **Look-At** pointer that tracks a CTRL Target; add a small lag/damp to avoid twitch.  
3) Rig a **State Blend** slider that morphs an icon from compact to expanded.  
4) Drive a **Time-Remap Scrubber** for a montage precomp—set “Playhead” to 0–100 for students to explore timing.  
5) Prototype a simple **2-bone IK** arm reaching for the Target; add a Pole to steer elbow direction.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Next → **Color & Lighting**: build global palettes, light-linked responses, and auto-toning rigs driven from a single controller.


<a id="color-and-lighting"></a>
## 🎨 Color & Lighting — Practical Motion Recipes
This section teaches you how to build color systems and pseudo-lighting directly inside After Effects using expressions.  
You’ll link palettes to controllers, automate tonal shifts, drive gradients from motion, and simulate environmental light sweeps—all fully procedural and keyframe-free.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### 🧭 Color Philosophy
- **Centralize color.** One “Master Color” drives every layer for effortless recoloring.
- **Use hue, brightness, and contrast as story tools, not decorations.**
- **Lighting in 2D ≠ real physics.** We mimic falloff, directionality, and reflection through gradients, blurs, and math.

Recommended setup:
- Create a Null named **CTRL**.
- Add the following Expression Controls:
  - Color Control → **Master Color**
  - Slider → **Light Intensity**
  - Slider → **Shadow Depth**
  - Angle Control → **Light Angle**
  - Checkbox → **Dynamic Lighting**

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### 1) Global Palette Control
**What it does:** applies one color palette across multiple elements.

**Where:** Shape Fill Color or Text Fill Color.

```js
C = thisComp.layer("CTRL");
C.effect("Master Color")("Color");
```

**Usage tip:** duplicate CTRL and recolor for alternative schemes (day/night, brand A/brand B).

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### 2) Light-Intensity → Brightness Mapping
**What it does:** converts a slider value (0–100) into brightness variations across layers.

**Where:** Shape Fill Color, set base color as value; add this expression.

```js
C = thisComp.layer("CTRL");
base = value; 
intensity = C.effect("Light Intensity")("Slider")/100;
base + [intensity*0.2, intensity*0.2, intensity*0.2, 0];
```

**Tune:** increase the 0.2 multipliers for stronger brightness reaction.  
**Example:** global “fade to daylight” when intensity ramps.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### 3) Directional Lighting (Angle-Based Highlight)
**What it does:** simulates light direction by altering brightness based on the layer’s position relative to a virtual angle.

**Where:** Shape Fill Color.

```js
C = thisComp.layer("CTRL");
ang = degreesToRadians(C.effect("Light Angle")("Angle"));
lightVec = [Math.cos(ang), Math.sin(ang)];
pos = toWorld(anchorPoint);
rel = normalize(pos - thisComp.width/2);
dot = clamp(dot(rel, lightVec), -1, 1);
brightness = linear(dot, -1, 1, 0.6, 1.4);
value*brightness;
```

**Tune:** adjust 0.6–1.4 range for contrast strength.  
**Example:** pseudo-sunlight sweep across icons.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### 4) Shadow Depth → Opacity Falloff
**What it does:** darkens objects based on distance from a virtual light source.

**Where:** Shape Layer Opacity.

```js
C=thisComp.layer("CTRL");
depth = C.effect("Shadow Depth")("Slider");
src = thisComp.layer("CTRL").toWorld([0,0,0]);
pos = toWorld(anchorPoint);
dist = length(pos - src);
linear(dist, 0, 600, 100, 100 - depth);
```

**Example:** as objects move away from the “light source,” they dim.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### 5) Motion-Linked Color Shift
**What it does:** shifts hue based on speed—adds energy to fast motion.

**Where:** Shape Fill Color.

```js
spd = length(velocity);
hsl = rgbToHsl(value);
hsl[0] += spd/1000;          // hue shift
hsl[1] = clamp(hsl[1],0,1);  // keep saturation safe
hsl[2] = clamp(hsl[2],0,1);  // keep brightness safe
hslToRgb(hsl);
```

**Tune:** smaller divisor (e.g., 800) = stronger hue change.  
**Example:** streaks that tint warmer when accelerating.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### 6) Auto Gradient Lighting (per-object two-tone)
**What it does:** creates an automatic gradient from top-to-bottom brightness or depth.

**Where:** Gradient Fill’s Start Color or End Color.

```js
C = thisComp.layer("CTRL");
intensity = C.effect("Light Intensity")("Slider")/100;
dir = normalize([0, -1]); // light from above
p = toWorld(anchorPoint);
val = linear(p[1], 0, thisComp.height, 1.2, 0.8);
value * val * (1 + intensity*0.5);
```

**Example:** UI panels with self-shading; pseudo-3D cylinders.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### 7) Flicker Light Pulse
**What it does:** generates organic flicker using random noise.

**Where:** Opacity, Exposure, or Color Brightness.

```js
freq = 5; amp = 15;
seedRandom(index + time*10, true);
value + (random(-amp, amp) * Math.sin(time*freq));
```

**Tip:** link `freq` and `amp` to CTRL sliders for art-directed chaos.  
**Example:** neon signage, projector jitter, candlelight.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### 8) Global Warm/Cool Tint Blend
**What it does:** lets a single slider fade the scene from cool (blue) to warm (orange).

**Where:** Adjustment Layer > Tint Effect > Map White To.

```js
C = thisComp.layer("CTRL");
S = C.effect("WarmCool")("Slider")/100;
cool = [0.3,0.6,1];
warm = [1,0.7,0.4];
linear(S,0,1,cool,warm);
```

**Add a “WarmCool” Slider** (0=cool, 100=warm) to CTRL.  
**Example:** dynamic time-of-day shifts.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### 9) Auto Color Balance on Exposure Change
**What it does:** keeps colors vibrant when global exposure changes.

**Where:** Adjustment Layer > Exposure Effect > Exposure Expression.

```js
C=thisComp.layer("CTRL");
exp = C.effect("Light Intensity")("Slider")/100;
exp*1.5 - 0.5; // scale and bias
```

Then on the Tint or Curves layer:
```js
C=thisComp.layer("CTRL");
exp = C.effect("Light Intensity")("Slider")/100;
linear(exp,0,1,1.0,1.2);
```

**Result:** bright scenes stay colorful; dim scenes avoid crush.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### 10) Procedural Rim Light Simulation
**What it does:** fakes rim-light edge glow based on angle to light source.

**Where:** Opacity of a duplicate layer set to “Add” blend mode.

```js
C=thisComp.layer("CTRL");
ang = degreesToRadians(C.effect("Light Angle")("Angle"));
lightVec = [Math.cos(ang), Math.sin(ang)];
n = normalize(toWorldVec([0,1,0]));
rim = clamp(dot(n, lightVec), 0, 1);
linear(rim,0,1,0,100);
```

**Example:** glowing edges reacting to virtual sunlight angle.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### 11) Motion Blur Compensation for Light Flicker
**What it does:** ties light intensity to comp’s shutter angle for cinematic flicker.

**Where:** Exposure or Glow Intensity.

```js
shutter = thisComp.frameDuration * thisComp.frameRate;
amp = shutter*120; // adjust scaling
value * (1 + Math.sin(time*amp)*0.05);
```

**Use:** subtle pulse matching motion-blur rhythm.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### 12) Color Loop for Abstract Backgrounds
**What it does:** cycles hue endlessly—useful for animated gradients.

**Where:** Solid Layer > Fill Color.

```js
speed = 0.1; // cycles per second
hsl = rgbToHsl(value);
hsl[0] += time*speed;
hslToRgb(hsl);
```

**Example:** looping pastel fields, ambient mood lighting.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### 🔧 Troubleshooting
- **Colors oversaturate:** clamp hue/brightness after conversion.  
- **Nothing changes:** verify effect names on CTRL match exactly.  
- **Flicker too strong:** lower amplitude or apply smooth() to time.  
- **Performance:** group related expressions on an Adjustment Layer and reference its result with sampleImage() for efficiency.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### 🧪 Practice Exercises
1. Build a **Master Color** rig controlling 10 layers; test instant recoloring.  
2. Add a **Light Angle** sweep animating across a logo.  
3. Create a **Warm/Cool** slider for “sunset → night” transition.  
4. Link **Motion Hue Shift** to a bouncing icon; observe live color energy.  
5. Combine **Flicker Pulse** + **Directional Light** for vintage film glow.

> 🪄 *Next:* **Professional Camera Rigging** introduces precision control of movement and perspective—building cinematic camera rigs from simple null-based systems to advanced multi-controller setups for real production use.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


<a id="professional-camera-rigging"></a>
## 🎥 Professional Camera Rigging — From Simple to Advanced
Camera rigs are the backbone of cinematic storytelling in After Effects. They turn a basic virtual camera into a responsive, art-directable instrument — letting you move, orbit, zoom, dolly, and tilt with tactile precision. Without a rig, your camera’s controls live on separate properties (Position, Point of Interest, Zoom, Rotation), making motion clunky and hard to repeat. Rigging consolidates those into a single Null (or stack of Nulls) with sliders, angles, and constraints.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### 🧭 Why Rig a Camera?
- **Precision:** separates local vs. global transforms (pan vs. orbit vs. dolly).  
- **Ease of Animation:** keyframe 2–3 properties instead of six.  
- **Physical Realism:** rigs emulate crane arms, dollies, tripods, or handheld systems.  
- **Reusability:** the same rig can serve multiple comps—just swap the subject.  
- **Protection:** prevents accidental zoom drift or point-of-interest flips.

In real productions, a camera rig behaves like a physical device — each control has a specific role (orbit, pan, tilt, dolly, focus, zoom). Rigs let artists “drive” the camera intuitively rather than fighting it.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## 1) Simple Camera Rig — Quick Creative Setup
**Goal:** a fast, artist-friendly rig with just one Null controller for Position, Orbit, and Zoom.

### 🧩 Build Steps
1. Create a **Camera** (Layer → New → Camera). Choose a focal length you like (35mm is a good start).  
2. Create a **Null Object** (Layer → New → Null Object) and make it **3D**.  
3. Rename it **CAM_CTRL**.  
4. Parent the **Camera** to **CAM_CTRL**.

Now the **Null** drives the camera. Rotating or moving CAM_CTRL moves the camera rig as if it were a real-world mount.

### ⚙️ Add Expression Controls to CAM_CTRL
Add these via *Effect > Expression Controls*:
- **Slider Control** → rename it **Zoom**
- **Slider Control** → rename it **Dolly**
- **Angle Control** → rename it **Tilt**
- **Angle Control** → rename it **Pan**

### 🧠 Link the Camera
Select the **Camera** and Alt/Option-click the following properties:

**Zoom (on Camera):**
```js
thisComp.layer("CAM_CTRL").effect("Zoom")("Slider");
```

**Point of Interest (optional):**
```js
p = thisComp.layer("CAM_CTRL").toWorld([0,0,0]);
p;
```

**Position (to include a dolly control):**
```js
ctrl = thisComp.layer("CAM_CTRL");
dolly = ctrl.effect("Dolly")("Slider");
value + [0, 0, dolly];
```

Now animating the **Zoom** or **Dolly** sliders creates beautiful camera pushes or pull-backs without manual coordinate editing.

### 💡 Tip: Lock Zoom to Position Depth
If you want zoom to move with dolly (for natural perspective), pickwhip the **Position Z** property directly to the **Zoom** slider:
```
[0,0,transform.position[2]] + [0,0,effect("Zoom")("Slider")];
```
or simply:
```js
[0, 0, thisComp.layer("CAM_CTRL").effect("Zoom")("Slider")];
```

### ✨ Simple Rig Summary
- **Fast setup** (less than a minute)
- **Perfect for** product rotations, UI fly-ins, and motion graphics shots.
- **Drawback:** lacks axis separation and fine-tuned speed/damping.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## 2) Advanced Professional Camera Rig — Studio-Grade Build
Now let’s design a modular, multi-control system — the kind used on real broadcast and film motion projects. It has:
- Layered controls (orbit, dolly, tilt, pan)
- Zoom, shake, focus, aim
- Lock toggles (checkboxes)
- Proper separation of axes

### 🧩 Step 1: Base Hierarchy
Create:
- **Camera**
- **Nulls:**
  1. **RIG_MASTER** (global transform)
  2. **RIG_ORBIT** (handles orbit/rotation)
  3. **RIG_DOLLY** (handles push/pull)
  4. **RIG_PAN_TILT** (handles angular motion)
  5. **RIG_SHAKE** (optional camera jitter)

Parent them as follows:

```
RIG_MASTER → RIG_ORBIT → RIG_DOLLY → RIG_PAN_TILT → Camera → RIG_SHAKE
```

### 🧩 Step 2: Add Controls (on RIG_MASTER)
Add these Expression Controls:
- **Slider**: Zoom, Dolly, Orbit Distance, Shake Intensity  
- **Angle**: Pan, Tilt  
- **Checkbox**: Lock Zoom, Enable Shake  
- **Point Control**: Target (for “look-at” mode)  
- **Slider**: Focus Distance (optional for DOF)  
- **Slider**: Handheld Frequency  

### 🧩 Step 3: Hook Up Expressions

#### Camera Zoom
```js
C = thisComp.layer("RIG_MASTER");
Z = C.effect("Zoom")("Slider");
if (C.effect("Lock Zoom")("Checkbox") > 0){
  value; // keep native zoom
}else{
  Z;
}
```

#### Dolly (push-pull)
Paste on **RIG_DOLLY → Position**:
```js
C = thisComp.layer("RIG_MASTER");
D = C.effect("Dolly")("Slider");
value + [0,0,D];
```

#### Orbit Motion (rotate around target)
Paste on **RIG_ORBIT → Rotation Y**:
```js
C = thisComp.layer("RIG_MASTER");
orbit = C.effect("Orbit Distance")("Slider");
time*orbit*10; // slow orbit; animate slider for rotation rate
```

#### Pan and Tilt (local orientation)
Paste on **RIG_PAN_TILT → Rotation**:
```js
C = thisComp.layer("RIG_MASTER");
p = C.effect("Pan")("Angle");
t = C.effect("Tilt")("Angle");
[p,t,0];
```

#### Shake (micro handheld)
Paste on **RIG_SHAKE → Position**:
```js
C = thisComp.layer("RIG_MASTER");
on = C.effect("Enable Shake")("Checkbox") > 0;
amp = C.effect("Shake Intensity")("Slider")/100;
freq = C.effect("Handheld Frequency")("Slider");
seedRandom(index,true);
offset = [amp*Math.sin(time*freq*2*Math.PI),
          amp*Math.sin((time+0.33)*freq*2*Math.PI),
          amp*Math.sin((time+0.77)*freq*1.3*Math.PI)];
value + (on ? offset : [0,0,0]);
```

#### Focus Distance (for DOF)
Paste on **Camera > Focus Distance**:
```js
C = thisComp.layer("RIG_MASTER");
C.effect("Focus Distance")("Slider");
```

#### Look-At Target (optional)
Paste on **Camera > Point of Interest**:
```js
C = thisComp.layer("RIG_MASTER");
C.effect("Target")("Point");
```

Now you have a complete cinematic rig — every core control on one layer.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### ⚙️ Using the Rig
- **Orbit:** Keyframe “Orbit Distance” for smooth turntables or parallax pans.  
- **Zoom:** Animate for focal length changes or dolly zoom effects.  
- **Pan/Tilt:** Use for responsive camera gestures (follows subject).  
- **Dolly:** Creates true Z-space travel without lens distortion.  
- **Shake:** Toggle on for realism; off for locked-off shots.  
- **Focus:** Connect to a target null for automatic rack focus.  

### 🔒 Zoom Locking Explained
Zoom changes lens field of view (FOV). Position Z changes spatial depth.  
If you want to “lock” zoom to physical motion, link **Zoom** to Position Z via a pickwhip:
```
[0,0,transform.position[2]] + [0,0,effect("Zoom")("Slider")];
```
That ensures the zoom follows the camera’s physical distance rather than lens distortion, giving a natural “tripod dolly” effect.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### 🧩 Step 4: Add a Unified Dashboard
To make the rig readable:
1. Add color labels to each Null:
   - MASTER = Cyan
   - ORBIT = Yellow
   - DOLLY = Magenta
   - PAN_TILT = Green
   - SHAKE = Red
2. Lock the camera to prevent accidental transform edits.
3. Parent the group to a “Scene Root” Null if working in multi-camera scenes.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### 💡 Pro Tips
- **Bake or Link?** Bake the camera animation only when delivering final composites; otherwise, keep linked for art direction flexibility.  
- **Null sizes:** scale Nulls up for visual clarity in the comp.  
- **Target transitions:** for scene cuts, duplicate the RIG_MASTER with new settings rather than overwriting mid-shot.  
- **Add Auto-Frame:** link the RIG_MASTER Position to the BoundingBox of the subject layer to auto-center the camera as the subject moves.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### 🧪 Practice Exercises
1. Build the Simple Camera Rig in a clean comp and keyframe Zoom + Dolly together for a smooth “crash zoom.”  
2. Build the Advanced Rig with all Nulls and Controls; orbit a subject while toggling Shake on/off.  
3. Create a rack focus using the Focus Distance slider linked to a target.  
4. Use the Orbit Distance and Dolly controls to create a full 360° turntable.  
5. Experiment with linking Zoom to Position Z (zoom lock) to mimic cinematic push-ins.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### 🔧 Troubleshooting
- **Camera won’t move:** check parenting order (Camera must be child of PAN_TILT, not of MASTER directly).  
- **Zoom jumps unexpectedly:** disable Lock Zoom or reset slider range.  
- **Shake too heavy:** lower Shake Intensity to below 5%.  
- **Rig drifts:** freeze master keyframes; keep rotation values low (<360°).  
- **Orbit flips upside down:** reset Orientation instead of Rotation to zero.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### 🎬 Wrap-Up
Camera rigs turn After Effects from a 2D animation tool into a true cinematography platform.  
Start with the **Simple Rig** for quick storytelling and graduate to the **Professional Rig** for cinematic control.  
With these setups, your virtual camera behaves like its real-world counterpart — smooth, layered, and intuitive.  

> 🪄 *Next:* “Environmental FX & Camera Systems” expands on this by connecting your camera rig to atmospheric depth, light sweeps, and parallax for cinematic environments.


<a id="professional-camera-rigging-part-ii-specialized-systems"></a>
## 🎥 Professional Camera Rigging – Part II (Specialized Systems)
The advanced side of camera rigging expands beyond a single controller and into intelligent systems — rigs that can switch cameras, follow subjects automatically, simulate handheld operators, or adapt to environments. These techniques bridge film cinematography and motion design, bringing dynamic control and realism into After Effects.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### 🧭 Overview: Why Specialized Rigs?
As shots grow complex, animating one camera is no longer enough.  
You may need:
- **Multi-camera angles** for edit-friendly sequences.  
- **Target-based tracking** for auto-follow and composition consistency.  
- **Handheld simulation** for realism.  
- **Auto-focus and rack-focus systems** that respond dynamically to subjects.  
- **Triggerable cinematic tools** for directors — toggled directly from a master control panel.

These specialized rigs allow your After Effects cameras to function like real production setups: switchers, dollies, and focus pullers — but all procedural and editable.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## 1) Multi-Camera Switching Rig
**What it does**  
Switches between two or more virtual cameras using a single controller slider or marker-based logic — perfect for cutting between angles without multiple comps.

### 🧩 Build Steps
1. Create **Camera_A**, **Camera_B**, and optionally **Camera_C**.  
2. Add a **Null** named **CAM_SWITCHER**.  
3. Add a **Slider Control** to it named **Camera Select** (0–100).  

### 📜 Expression (paste on a “Controller Camera” Position, Orientation, and Zoom)
```js
C = thisComp.layer("CAM_SWITCHER");
S = C.effect("Camera Select")("Slider");
A = thisComp.layer("Camera_A");
B = thisComp.layer("Camera_B");
t = linear(S, 0, 100, 0, 1);

posA = A.position;
posB = B.position;
oriA = A.orientation;
oriB = B.orientation;
zoomA = A.cameraOption.zoom;
zoomB = B.cameraOption.zoom;

// interpolate between A and B
interpPos = linear(t, 0, 1, posA, posB);
interpOri = linear(t, 0, 1, oriA, oriB);
interpZoom = linear(t, 0, 1, zoomA, zoomB);

[position, orientation, zoom] = [interpPos, interpOri, interpZoom];
```

**Usage:**  
- Set **Camera Select** to 0 for A, 100 for B, and keyframe between them.  
- Add more cameras by extending the interpolation chain (A→B→C).  
- Works well with **Layer Markers** (e.g., switch when marker passes time).

**Pro Tip:** Add a *Hold Interpolation* to get instant “cuts” between camera states.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## 2) Auto-Focus & Rack-Focus Targeting
**What it does**  
Dynamically calculates focus distance to a moving target (object or null), mimicking a real focus puller.

**Setup:**  
- Add **Focus Target** (Null).  
- Add **Slider Control** on CTRL named “Focus Offset” (for creative bias).  
- Enable DOF in Camera Options.

**Paste on Camera > Focus Distance:**
```js
camPos = toWorld([0,0,0]);
target = thisComp.layer("Focus Target").toWorld([0,0,0]);
offset = thisComp.layer("CTRL").effect("Focus Offset")("Slider");
dist = length(target - camPos);
dist + offset;
```

**Usage:**  
- Animate Focus Target’s Z-position for cinematic rack-focus moves.  
- Adjust Focus Offset for slightly over/under-focused looks.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## 3) Target-Based Dolly Rig (with Inertia)
**What it does**  
Moves the camera closer/farther from a target while maintaining orientation and smooth motion.

**Setup:**  
- Create a **Camera** parented to a **Null** named **DOLLY_CTRL**.  
- Add **Slider Control**: “Follow Distance” and “Lag Amount”.

**Paste on DOLLY_CTRL Position:**
```js
C=thisComp.layer("CTRL");
target = thisComp.layer("Focus Target").toWorld([0,0,0]);
follow = C.effect("Follow Distance")("Slider");
lag = C.effect("Lag Amount")("Slider");
camPos = thisLayer.toWorld(anchorPoint);

dir = normalize(target - camPos);
goal = target - dir*follow;
value + (goal - value)/lag;
```

**Result:**  
Camera glides into range and holds smooth distance from target, ideal for orbit or hero-product shots.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## 4) Look-At & Aim Rig (with Smoothing)
**What it does**  
Creates smooth, lagging “look-at” movement for cameras that track moving objects without jitter.

**Setup:**  
- Add **Target Null** (named “AIM_TARGET”).  
- On **Camera Orientation**:

```js
target = thisComp.layer("AIM_TARGET");
lag = 6; // smooth factor
camPos = toWorld(anchorPoint);
tarPos = target.toWorld(anchorPoint);
v = tarPos - camPos;
lookAt(v + (value - v)/lag);
```

**Variation:**  
Use `orientation = lookAt(tarPos - camPos);` for instant tracking (no lag).  
For smoother cinematic results, combine both.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## 5) Handheld Operator Simulation (Procedural)
**What it does**  
Adds realistic shoulder-camera motion: micro-breathing, organic bump, and subtle inertia.

**Setup:**  
- On Camera **Position** (or a parent Null):
```js
amp = 20;  // pixel amplitude
freq = 1.2; // movement frequency
seedRandom(index, true);
t = time*freq*2*Math.PI;

x = amp*Math.sin(t)*0.4;
y = amp*Math.cos(t*0.8)*0.3;
z = amp*Math.sin(t*0.3)*0.2;

smoothness = 0.25; // optional motion ease
smooth(value + [x,y,z], smoothness);
```

**Tip:** Animate amplitude from 0–20 during handheld segments to fade in/out realism.  
**Add random drift** with `wiggle(0.1, 5)` for ambient shake.  
This simulates operator breathing and arm weight shifts.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## 6) Multi-Axis Master Rig (Professional Hybrid)
**What it does**  
Combines orbit, dolly, pan/tilt, and zoom into a master multi-control system—fully parametric and modular.

**Setup:**  
- Create **CAM_MASTER** (Null).  
- Add:
  - Sliders: Orbit Distance, Dolly Offset, Orbit Speed, Zoom, Shake Intensity  
  - Angle Controls: Pan, Tilt  
  - Checkbox: Lock Zoom, Enable Shake  
  - Point Control: Focus Target

**Parent hierarchy:**  
`CAM_MASTER → CAMERA`.

**Expressions:**

**Camera Position (orbit + dolly):**
```js
C = thisComp.layer("CAM_MASTER");
orbit = C.effect("Orbit Distance")("Slider");
speed = C.effect("Orbit Speed")("Slider");
dolly = C.effect("Dolly Offset")("Slider");

x = Math.cos(time*speed*2*Math.PI)*orbit;
y = 0;
z = Math.sin(time*speed*2*Math.PI)*orbit + dolly;
[x,y,z];
```

**Camera Zoom:**
```js
C = thisComp.layer("CAM_MASTER");
if (C.effect("Lock Zoom")("Checkbox")>0){
  value;
}else{
  C.effect("Zoom")("Slider");
}
```

**Camera Orientation (look-at):**
```js
target = thisComp.layer("CAM_MASTER").effect("Focus Target")("Point");
lookAt(target - toWorld(anchorPoint));
```

**Optional Shake (Position or Orientation):**
```js
C=thisComp.layer("CAM_MASTER");
on=C.effect("Enable Shake")("Checkbox")>0;
amp=C.effect("Shake Intensity")("Slider");
freq=1.5;
seedRandom(index,true);
wig = on ? wiggle(freq,amp) : [0,0,0];
value + wig;
```

**Usage:**
- Animate Orbit Speed to create cinematic sweeps.
- Animate Dolly Offset for push/pull.
- Enable Shake for realism.
- Adjust Pan/Tilt angles to control framing.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## 7) Scene-Based Camera Switcher (Automation)
**What it does**  
Switches active cameras automatically based on timeline markers or scene ranges.

**Setup:**  
Add markers to a **Master Null** with names matching cameras (“CamA”, “CamB”).  
On a “Main Camera” Opacity property:

```js
ctrl = thisComp.layer("MASTER_CTRL");
n = 0;
if (ctrl.marker.numKeys>0){
  n = ctrl.marker.nearestKey(time).index;
  if (ctrl.marker.key(n).time > time) n--;
}
if (n>0){
  activeName = ctrl.marker.key(n).comment;
  activeName == thisLayer.name ? 100 : 0;
}else{
  0;
}
```

**Usage:**  
Each camera turns visible only during its marker’s scene. Perfect for pre-cut edits.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## 8) Gimbal Rig (3-Axis Control)
**What it does**  
Emulates real-world gimbals and stabilizers — isolates axes for natural pivoting.

**Setup:**  
Create three Nulls:  
- **GIMBAL_YAW** (rotates around Y)  
- **GIMBAL_PITCH** (rotates around X)  
- **GIMBAL_ROLL** (rotates around Z)  
Parent them Yaw → Pitch → Roll → Camera.  
Add **Angle Controls** for each on a **GIMBAL_CTRL** layer.

**Expressions:**
```js
C=thisComp.layer("GIMBAL_CTRL");
yaw = C.effect("Yaw")("Angle");
pitch = C.effect("Pitch")("Angle");
roll = C.effect("Roll")("Angle");
[yaw, pitch, roll];
```

**Usage:**  
Animate the gimbal axes for smooth drone, steadicam, or aircraft-like movement.  
Link to sliders for live control.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## 9) Drone/FPV Mode (Cinematic Curves)
**What it does**  
Adds aeronautic realism to camera rigs — roll and pitch tied to velocity and curvature.

**Setup:**  
On **Camera Orientation**:
```js
vel = velocity;
pitch = linear(vel[2], -1000, 1000, -10, 10);
roll = linear(vel[0], -1000, 1000, 10, -10);
[value[0]+pitch, value[1], value[2]+roll];
```

**Use:**  
For fast, immersive “drone flythroughs” or digital FPV cinematics.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### 🧪 Practice Exercises
1. Build a **Multi-Camera Switcher** and animate slider cuts for a mock interview.  
2. Create an **Auto-Focus Rig** with two moving targets and keyframe rack-focus.  
3. Combine **Target-Based Dolly Rig** + **Look-At Smoothing** for follow-cam shots.  
4. Set up a **Gimbal Rig** for a drone-style flythrough and add shake.  
5. Use **Scene Switcher** markers to pre-cut a full sequence in one comp.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### 🔧 Troubleshooting
- **Camera jumps between rigs:** freeze transforms before switching or use hold keyframes.  
- **Focus flicker:** limit Focus Offset range or smooth() the Focus Distance.  
- **Shake breaks look-at:** apply shake to a parent Null instead of the camera directly.  
- **Multi-cam lag:** use proxy cameras with lower res during edit, then relink to masters.  
- **Orbit drift:** keep the camera and target aligned — zero Orientation before parenting.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### 🎬 Summary
Professional camera rigs go beyond ease—they enable storytelling.  
From auto-tracking to rack-focus, these systems give After Effects artists true cinematographic control, blending math, motion, and creative instinct.  
Once mastered, you’ll think less like an animator and more like a **director of photography** — commanding movement, focus, and light with precision.

> 🪄 *Next:* **Professional Camera Rigging – Part III (Motion Design Systems)** expands these concepts into motion-design workflows—introducing spline-based paths, orbit stabilization, auto-framing, and cinematic motion behaviors tailored for title sequences and design-driven animation.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

<a id="professional-camera-rigging-part-iii-motion-design-systems"></a>
## 🎬 Professional Camera Rigging – Part III (Motion Design Systems)
Cinematic storytelling meets motion-graphics precision.  
This chapter focuses on camera path design, auto-framing, spline motion, orbit stabilization, and camera choreography for title sequences, data-driven visualizations, and dynamic explainer scenes.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### 🧭 Core Idea
Where Parts I–II built *control rigs*, this part builds *behaviour systems* — camera motion that understands composition, follows splines, and maintains framing automatically.  

Key benefits:
- **Repeatability:** exact orbital paths, reusable templates.  
- **Composition safety:** camera keeps subjects within the rule-of-thirds.  
- **Spline smoothness:** no jerky keyframes; motion follows Bézier math.  
- **Collision awareness:** prevents camera from clipping through geometry.  

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## 1) Spline Path Rig (Orbit & Follow)
**What it does**  
Moves the camera along any 3D path layer (shape or mask) with automatic orientation.

**Setup**  
1. Draw a *Path Layer* named `CAM_PATH`.  
2. Create a *Null* named `CAM_SPLINE_CTRL` with a **Slider** called `Percent Along Path` (0–100).  
3. Parent your Camera to the Null.  

**Paste on CAM_SPLINE_CTRL Position**
```js
p = thisComp.layer("CAM_PATH").mask("Mask 1").path;
t = effect("Percent Along Path")("Slider")/100;
p.pointOnPath(t);
```

**Optional – Automatic Orientation**
```js
p = thisComp.layer("CAM_PATH").mask("Mask 1").path;
t = effect("Percent Along Path")("Slider")/100;
lookAt(p.pointOnPath(t), p.pointOnPath(t+0.01));
```

**Use**  
Animate the slider for a perfect dolly/arc shot.  
Duplicate for multiple cameras following the same spline with time offsets.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## 2) Auto-Framing System (Rule of Thirds Framer)
**What it does**  
Keeps the subject inside an ideal composition zone automatically, using a bounding-box tracker.  

**Setup**  
- Create a **Target Null** called `SUBJECT`.  
- Add a **Point Control** on `CTRL` named `Framing Offset`.

**Paste on Camera Position or POI**
```js
target = thisComp.layer("SUBJECT").toComp([0,0]);
offset = thisComp.layer("CTRL").effect("Framing Offset")("Point");
compCenter = [thisComp.width/2, thisComp.height/2];
desired = compCenter + offset;
pos = value + (desired - target)*0.05; // smoothing factor
pos;
```

**Result**  
The camera subtly pans to maintain rule-of-thirds framing even if the subject drifts.  
Perfect for interviews, data callouts, or animated charts.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## 3) Orbit Stabilizer (Rotate Around Subject with Auto-Tilt)
**What it does**  
Orbits smoothly around a subject while keeping horizon level and focus constant.  

**Setup**  
Add to **Camera Position** (parented to a CTRL Null).  
```js
C = thisComp.layer("CTRL");
radius = C.effect("Orbit Radius")("Slider");
speed  = C.effect("Orbit Speed")("Slider");
tilt   = C.effect("Tilt")("Angle");

center = thisComp.layer("SUBJECT").toWorld([0,0,0]);
ang = time*speed*2*Math.PI;

[x,y,z] = [Math.cos(ang)*radius, Math.sin(tilt*Math.PI/180)*radius, Math.sin(ang)*radius];
center + [x,y,z];
```

**Tip**  
Add a small Ease Out curve on Orbit Speed for cinematic starts/stops.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## 4) Path Ease & Camera Acceleration
**What it does**  
Smooths camera speed along splines using easing math (mimicking crane inertia).  

**Expression on Percent Along Path Slider**
```js
easeInOut(time, inPoint, outPoint, 0, 100);
```

Or manually:
```js
linear(Math.sin(time*Math.PI/2), 0, 1, 0, 100);
```

**Result**  
Camera accelerates gently and decelerates gracefully at endpoints.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## 5) Collision-Safe Camera (Proximity Clamp)
**What it does**  
Stops camera from intersecting geometry layers.  

**Setup**  
Add a **Point Control** on CTRL named `Obstacle`.  

**Paste on Camera Position**
```js
camPos = value;
obst = thisComp.layer("CTRL").effect("Obstacle")("Point");
minDist = 200; // pixels
d = length(obst - camPos);
if (d < minDist){
  dir = normalize(camPos - obst);
  obst + dir*minDist;
}else{
  camPos;
}
```

**Use**  
Prevents collisions in product fly-throughs or 3D UI scenes.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## 6) Camera Follow Spline + Target
**What it does**  
Combines path-following with continuous subject tracking.  

**Setup**  
Use `CAM_PATH` for motion and `SUBJECT` as target.  

**Camera Position**
```js
p = thisComp.layer("CAM_PATH").mask("Mask 1").path;
t = effect("Percent Along Path")("Slider")/100;
p.pointOnPath(t);
```
**Camera Orientation**
```js
sub = thisComp.layer("SUBJECT").toWorld([0,0,0]);
pos = toWorld(anchorPoint);
lookAt(sub - pos);
```

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## 7) Dynamic Depth and Focus System
**What it does**  
Links focus and aperture automatically to camera speed for realism.  

**Focus Distance**
```js
spd = length(velocity);
linear(spd, 0, 1500, 500, 1500);
```

**Aperture**
```js
spd = length(velocity);
linear(spd, 0, 1500, 10, 60);
```

**Use**  
Slow moves = shallow DOF; fast moves = deeper focus (like a real lens pull).

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## 8) Camera Look-At Chain (Subject → Secondary → Environment)
**What it does**  
Blends between multiple targets — e.g., character → UI panel → horizon.  

**Setup**  
Add three **Point Controls**: Primary, Secondary, Tertiary.  
Add a **Slider** `Focus Blend` (0–100).

```js
C = thisComp.layer("CTRL");
p1 = C.effect("Primary")("Point");
p2 = C.effect("Secondary")("Point");
p3 = C.effect("Tertiary")("Point");
b  = C.effect("Focus Blend")("Slider")/100;

mix12 = linear(b, 0, 0.5, p1, p2);
mix23 = linear(b, 0.5, 1, p2, p3);
final = b < 0.5 ? mix12 : mix23;
lookAt(final - toWorld(anchorPoint));
```

**Use**  
Smooth camera gazes between storytelling elements without jump cuts.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## 9) Spline Bank and Scene Presets
**Concept**  
Store reusable spline paths (dolly, orbit, crane) as guide layers.  
Reference them by name using expressions like:
```js
thisComp.layer("CAM_PATH_ORBIT").mask("Path 1").path.pointOnPath(time%1);
```
Combine with the **Scene Switcher** rig (Part II) for one-comp shot management.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## 10) Auto-Compose Fit Rig
**What it does**  
Centers camera framing on dynamically sized compositions or text blocks.  

**Setup**  
Add a null **Frame Box** parented to subject; link camera distance to its bounding box.

```js
rect = thisComp.layer("Frame Box").sourceRectAtTime(time,false);
scale = rect.width/thisComp.width;
z = linear(scale, 0, 1, 1500, 600);
[value[0], value[1], z];
```

**Result**  
Camera automatically adjusts distance to maintain perfect layout framing when text or elements resize.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### 🧪 Practice Exercises
1. Animate a Spline Path Rig following a product reveal curve; use Auto-Framing for subject stability.  
2. Combine Orbit Stabilizer with Collision Clamp to keep safe distance from geometry.  
3. Build a Multi-Target Look-At chain for character → object → horizon transitions.  
4. Add Dynamic Depth System to accentuate fast motion.  
5. Test Auto-Compose Fit on titles that change length automatically.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### 🔧 Troubleshooting
- **Spline path jerks:** ensure the path is open, not closed, or offset by +0.01 t when sampling.  
- **Camera flips:** reset Orientation to [0,0,0]; use lookAt instead of toWorldVec differences.  
- **Focus flicker:** apply smooth() to Focus Distance for temporal averaging.  
- **Collision clamp jumps:** keep minDist proportional to scene scale (1–5% of comp width).  
- **Auto-framing drifts:** increase interpolation factor (0.05 → 0.1) for faster correction.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### 🎬 Summary
Motion-Design Camera Systems elevate After Effects to a professional cinematic toolset.  
By combining spline motion, auto-framing, and dynamic depth, you can choreograph shots with physical accuracy and artistic intent — all without touching a single keyframe.  
These rigs form the backbone of high-end broadcast design, UI motion, and narrative title sequences.

## 🌫️ Environmental FX & Camera Systems — Practical Motion Recipes
This chapter focuses on *cinematic space*: haze, fog, depth, light rays, and practical camera rigs. You’ll build depth-aware looks, parallax that sells scale, and camera behaviors (handheld, orbit, dolly, rack focus) that feel like a real shoot.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### 🧭 Concepts You’ll Use
- **Depth ≠ 3D only.** In 2.5D comps you can fake depth from distance-to-camera, layer order, or a custom grayscale “depth map.”
- **Atmosphere sells scale.** Minimal haze + parallax beats heavy VFX for most UI/graphics shots.
- **Camera first, FX second.** Rig motion you love → then make FX react to it (distance, angle, speed).

**Controller suggestion (on CTRL):**
- Sliders: **Haze Amount**, **Ray Intensity**, **Shake Amount**, **Dolly Speed**
- Angle: **Light Angle**
- Color: **Fog Color**
- Checkbox: **Enable Handheld**
- Point: **Focus Target**

You’ll reference controls like:
```js
C=thisComp.layer("CTRL");
haze=C.effect("Haze Amount")("Slider");
ray =C.effect("Ray Intensity")("Slider");
shake=C.effect("Shake Amount")("Slider");
```

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## 1) Depth Haze / Fog (2.5D friendly)
**What it does**  
Adds atmospheric perspective so distant layers fade toward a fog color.

**Where**  
On an **Adjustment Layer** above your scene → apply *Fill* (or *Tint*) and *Exposure/Curves*. Paste on **Opacity**:

```js
C = thisComp.layer("CTRL");
fog = C.effect("Haze Amount")("Slider"); // 0..100
// assume 2.5D: use camera distance for depth
cam = thisComp.activeCamera.toWorld([0,0,0]);
p   = thisLayer.sampleImage(thisLayer.fromComp(cam), [thisComp.width,thisComp.height]); // placeholder sample; opacity uses a base ramp instead:
linear(0,0,1,0,1); // (kept for structure)
```

**Better: per-layer version (on each layer’s Opacity)**  
Fade each layer by its distance to camera; use an Adjustment Layer with *Fill* set to your **Fog Color** above all layers.

```js
C=thisComp.layer("CTRL");
fog = C.effect("Haze Amount")("Slider"); // 0..100
cam = thisComp.activeCamera;
camPos = cam.toWorld([0,0,0]);
d = length(toWorld(anchorPoint) - camPos);   // pixel distance
near = 200; far = 3000;                      // tune to your scene scale
fogPct = linear(d, near, far, 0, 100);
clamp(fogPct * (fog/100), 0, 100);
```

**Tune**  
- Increase **far** for larger scenes; adjust **near** so close objects stay crisp.  
**Example**  
3 layered skylines: front text reads crisp, far buildings melt into fog.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## 2) Parallax by Camera (2.5D stacks)
**What it does**  
Simple, robust 2.5D parallax: background moves less than foreground as camera moves.

**Where**  
Use **3D layers**; different Z positions; animate/dolly the **Camera Position**. To auto-offset background layers relative to a “base plate”:

```js
// On BG layer Position: follow camera with reduced factor
cam   = thisComp.activeCamera;
factor= 0.2; // 0=no follow (static), 1=sticks to camera; small values = big parallax
world = toWorld(anchorPoint);
camPan= cam.toWorld([0,0,0]) - cam.position; // camera translation proxy
value + (camPan * factor);
```

**Tip**  
Manually place layers at different Z values for stronger depth.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## 3) Volumetric Light Rays (fake, fast)
**What it does**  
Creates directional “God rays” that react to camera/angle.

**Where**  
Duplicate your bright element (text/logo), blur it heavily, set to **Add** blend mode. On duplicate **Opacity**:

```js
C=thisComp.layer("CTRL");
ang = degreesToRadians(C.effect("Light Angle")("Angle"));
ray = C.effect("Ray Intensity")("Slider");
dir = [Math.cos(ang), Math.sin(ang)];
// intensity grows with alignment to direction (cheap dot trick)
n = normalize(toWorldVec([0,-1,0]));
align = clamp(dot(n, dir), 0, 1);
linear(align, 0, 1, 0, ray);
```

**Tip**  
Stack with *Radial Blur (Zoom)* centered off-screen along the light angle.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## 4) Camera Orbit Rig (clean, predictable)
**What it does**  
Orbits a camera around a subject at a fixed radius with easy art direction.

**Where**  
On **Camera Position** (leave Point of Interest at the subject or use a target Null).

```js
C=thisComp.layer("CTRL");
speed=C.effect("Dolly Speed")("Slider")/100; // rotations/sec
radius=1200;
center=thisComp.layer("Subject").toWorld([0,0,0]);
ang = time*speed*2*Math.PI;
[x, y, z] = [Math.cos(ang)*radius, -200, Math.sin(ang)*radius];
center + [x,y,z];
```

**Tip**  
Animate **radius** for dynamic orbit in/out; keyframe **y** for subtle boom.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## 5) Handheld / Micro-Jitter (tasteful)
**What it does**  
Adds organic micro-movement to camera without seasickness.

**Where**  
On **Camera Position** (or a parent Null). Keep small.

```js
C=thisComp.layer("CTRL");
on = C.effect("Enable Handheld")("Checkbox")>0;
amt = C.effect("Shake Amount")("Slider"); // 0..100
seedRandom(0,true);
freq1=0.8; freq2=1.3;
x = amt*0.6*Math.sin(time*freq1*2*Math.PI);
y = amt*0.4*Math.sin((time+0.37)*freq2*2*Math.PI);
z = amt*0.3*Math.sin((time+0.71)*0.5*2*Math.PI);
value + (on ? [x,y,z] : [0,0,0]);
```

**Tip**  
Less is more. 2–8 px is enough for UI/product; more for gritty handheld.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## 6) Speed-Reactive Motion Blur / Exposure
**What it does**  
Brightens or blurs slightly when camera moves quickly.

**Where**  
Adjustment Layer → *Exposure* (or Glow) → **Exposure** expression:

```js
cam = thisComp.activeCamera;
dt = thisComp.frameDuration;
p1 = cam.position;
p0 = cam.position.valueAtTime(time - dt);
spd = length(p1 - p0)/dt;     // px/sec
gain = clamp(spd/4000, 0, 0.35);
value + gain;
```

**Example**  
Tasteful highlight lift on fast sliders/pans.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## 7) Rack Focus (target-based DOF)
**What it does**  
Automatically sets **Focus Distance** to a target Null for reliable rack focus.

**Where**  
On **Camera > Focus Distance**:

```js
target = thisComp.layer("CTRL").effect("Focus Target")("Point");
cam    = thisComp.activeCamera;
camPos = cam.toWorld([0,0,0]);
// convert target comp point to 3D ray from camera
tWorld = cam.fromCompToWorld([target[0], target[1], 0]);
length(tWorld - camPos);
```

**Tip**  
Enable DOF on camera; control **Aperture** for depth strength.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## 8) Depth-Driven Fake DOF (works without camera DOF)
**What it does**  
Blurs layers based on distance to camera—fast fallback when real DOF is too heavy.

**Where**  
On each layer’s *Gaussian Blur* **Blurriness**:

```js
camPos = thisComp.activeCamera.toWorld([0,0,0]);
d = length(toWorld(anchorPoint) - camPos);
near= 300; far= 2500; maxBlur = 24;
amt = linear(d, near, far, 0, maxBlur);
clamp(amt, 0, maxBlur);
```

**Tip**  
Blur backgrounds more; keep hero layers with lower maxBlur.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## 9) Light Sweep / Sheen (angle + time)
**What it does**  
Adds a moving highlight band across text/logos based on light angle.

**Where**  
Use a duplicate set to **Add** with a feathered mask. On **Opacity**:

```js
C=thisComp.layer("CTRL");
ang = degreesToRadians(C.effect("Light Angle")("Angle"));
dir = [Math.cos(ang), Math.sin(ang)];
// project world position onto light direction
p = toWorld(anchorPoint);
t = (p[0]*dir[0] + p[1]*dir[1]) / 1000 + time*0.3; // scale + time sweep
band = 1 - Math.abs(fract(t)*2 - 1); // 0..1 triangle wave
linear(band, 0.6, 1, 0, 100);
```

**Tune**  
Increase the slope of `band` mapping for tighter sweeps.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## 10) Distance-Aware Particles (fog dust / motes)
**What it does**  
Makes particles more/less visible based on camera distance for believable depth.

**Where**  
On particle layer **Opacity**:

```js
camPos = thisComp.activeCamera.toWorld([0,0,0]);
d = length(toWorld(anchorPoint) - camPos);
near=200; far=2400;
linear(d, near, far, 100, 10); // nearer = denser
```

**Tip**  
Use CC Particle World/Particular for emission; keep sizes tiny, speeds low.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## 11) Auto-Parallax for 2D UI (no 3D required)
**What it does**  
Creates parallax drift linked to mouse/target in 2D comps (promo sites, dashboards).

**Where**  
On a group’s **Position**:

```js
C=thisComp.layer("CTRL");
T=C.effect("Focus Target")("Point"); // repurpose as “parallax target”
strength = 0.08;
center = [thisComp.width/2, thisComp.height/2];
offset = (T - center) * strength;
value + [offset[0], offset[1]];
```

**Use**  
Move the target to “parallax” the UI stack subtly for depth.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## 12) Cinematic Framing Overlay (guides, not FX)
**What it does**  
Draws safe area / aspect bars driven by one slider.

**Where**  
On a dedicated shape overlay layer’s **Opacity**:

```js
C=thisComp.layer("CTRL");
bars = C.effect("Cinematic Bars")("Slider"); // 0..100
bars; // simply show/hide; animate slider to on/off
```

Add a **Rectangle** scaled to create letterbox bars; tie its **Size** to comp height with an expression if you want responsive bars.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### 🔧 Troubleshooting
- **Parallax too strong** → lower radius or parallax factor; keep orbits shallow for UI.
- **Rays look cheesy** → keep Add/Screen duplicates subtle; stack blur + light angle.
- **DOF noisy/slow** → use Fake DOF (per-layer blur) or limit DOF to hero objects.
- **Handheld feels seasick** → lower Shake Amount and frequencies; keep Z wobble tiny.
- **Haze washes color** → tint your fog toward scene palette; apply slight contrast after haze.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### 🧪 Practice Exercises
1) Build a 2.5D parallax scene (3 planes); add depth haze and a slow camera orbit.  
2) Add a Light Sweep to a logo and keyframe Light Angle to rake across it.  
3) Set up Rack Focus between two text cards using Focus Target.  
4) Create a Fake DOF pass for a dense UI scene; compare render speed vs Camera DOF.  
5) Add tasteful Handheld to a dolly pass, then modulate Exposure with camera speed.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Next → **Time & Looping**: global speed controls, beats, markers, and procedural time tricks for complex sequences.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

<a id="time-and-looping"></a>
## ⏱️ Time & Looping — Practical Systems for Rhythm and Reuse
This chapter turns time into a design tool. You’ll learn dependable patterns for loops, beats, remapping, offsets, and clocks—so sequences stay editable, on-rhythm, and reuseable across shots.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### 🧭 Principles
- **Loops**: Either loop existing keyframes or generate time functions (sine, triangle, noise).
- **Offsets**: Stagger many layers with index/time math (no duplicated keyframes).
- **Remap**: Treat time like a value you can scale, clamp, and snap—great for edits.
- **Markers & BPM**: Convert musical or editorial structure into deterministic triggers.

Recommended controller on **CTRL**:
- Slider: **Global Speed** (100 = normal)
- Slider: **BPM**
- Slider: **Beat Subdivision** (e.g., 1, 2, 4)
- Slider: **Loop Length (sec)**
- Checkbox: **Quantize to Beat**

Access pattern:
```js
C=thisComp.layer("CTRL");
gSpeed = C.effect("Global Speed")("Slider")/100;
bpm    = C.effect("BPM")("Slider");
div    = Math.max(1, C.effect("Beat Subdivision")("Slider"));
loopLen= Math.max(0.01, C.effect("Loop Length (sec)")("Slider"));
quant  = C.effect("Quantize to Beat")("Checkbox")>0;
```

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## 1) Looping Existing Keyframes (the reliable trio)
**What it does**  
Extends animation without more keys. Paste on any keyframed property.

```js
// Endless forward cycle through keys
loopOut("cycle")

// Ping-pong (forward then backward)
loopOut("pingpong")

// Hold (repeat last value)
loopOut("continue") // for trajectory continuation on motion; use "hold" for hard holds
```

**Tip**: Combine with a short “unit cycle” (e.g., 12–24 frames) to keep loops snappy and light.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## 2) Time Oscillators (no keys required)
**What it does**  
Generates motion from time. Great for subtle life in UI/product shots.

```js
amp=15; freq=0.8;   // units depend on property (deg, px, %, etc.)
value + amp*Math.sin(freq*time*2*Math.PI)
```

Variants:
```js
// Triangle wave (linear up/down)
phase = time*freq%1; 
tri = 1 - Math.abs(phase*2 - 1);
value + amp*(tri*2-1)

// Noise drift (organic)
seedRandom(index,true);
value + wiggle(0.2, amp) // freq, amp
```

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## 3) Global Speed Dial (slow-mo & time-crunch)
**What it does**  
Multiplies perceived time across any expression without touching keys.

```js
C=thisComp.layer("CTRL");
speed = C.effect("Global Speed")("Slider")/100;
t = inPoint + (time - inPoint)*speed;
valueAtTime(t)  // replace 'time' with 't' inside your expressions
```

**Use**: preview fast, render slow; ease editorial timing without re-animating.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## 4) Loop by Time Window (hard length in seconds)
**What it does**  
Guarantees a loop of exactly N seconds (even without keyframes).

```js
len = Math.max(0.01, thisComp.layer("CTRL").effect("Loop Length (sec)")("Slider"));
period = (time - inPoint) % len;
start = inPoint;
valueAtTime(start + period)
```

**Use**: icon cycles, ambient UI loops, loading animations.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## 5) Index-Based Time Offset (duplicate-friendly waves)
**What it does**  
Staggers duplicates using layer index—zero maintenance cascading.

```js
perIdx = 0.06; // seconds per layer
lag = (index-1)*perIdx;
valueAtTime(time - lag)
```

**Tip**: For reverse cascades use `-(index-1)` or reorder layers for different rhythm.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## 6) Beat & BPM Quantizer (music-aware timing)
**What it does**  
Snaps actions to musical grid. Paste on **Time Remap** or any animated property to quantize motion.

```js
C=thisComp.layer("CTRL");
bpm = Math.max(1, C.effect("BPM")("Slider"));
div = Math.max(1, C.effect("Beat Subdivision")("Slider")); // 1,2,4...
secPerBeat = 60/bpm/div;
q = Math.floor((time-inPoint)/secPerBeat)*secPerBeat + inPoint; // snapped time
// use q instead of time:
valueAtTime(q)
```

**Variant**: Only snap when checkbox is on; else use real time.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## 7) Marker-Driven Time Jumps (editorial cues)
**What it does**  
Jumps or punches animation when hitting markers—perfect for cuts, hits, or lyric sync.

```js
n=0;
if (marker.numKeys>0){
  n=marker.nearestKey(time).index;
  if (marker.key(n).time>time) n--;
}
if (n>0){
  t = time - marker.key(n).time;    // time since last marker
  // Example: punch scale for 0.18s after a marker
  if (t<0.18){
    k = Math.sin(10*t*2*Math.PI)*Math.exp(-6*t);
    value + k*12;
  } else value;
}else value;
```

**Tip**: Place markers at beats; multiple layers react consistently.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## 8) Time-Remap Controller (play, pause, scrub, ping-pong)
**What it does**  
Turns a slider into a playhead for a precomp or footage.

**Setup**  
- Enable **Time Remap** on the layer (Layer → Time → Enable Time Remapping).
- Add **Slider** on CTRL named **Playhead** (0–100).

**Expression on Time Remap:**
```js
C=thisComp.layer("CTRL");
S=C.effect("Playhead")("Slider"); // 0..100
srcDur = thisLayer.source.duration;
linear(S,0,100,0,srcDur)
```

**Extras**  
- Add ease curves to S for accelerations.  
- For ping-pong: `loopOut("pingpong")` on **Playhead** keyframes.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## 9) Hold-Step Animator (retro/stepped motion)
**What it does**  
Quantizes time into steps (8-bit, on-twos, etc.).

```js
steps = 6; // bigger = smoother
t = Math.floor(time*steps)/steps;
valueAtTime(t)
```

**Variants**: drive `steps` from CTRL for live tuning; combine with Posterize Time effect for global stepping.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## 10) Glide-Through Cuts (no pop at loop seam)
**What it does**  
Blends end→start over a short crossfade window so loops don’t pop.

```js
len = 2.0;           // loop length seconds
blend = 0.2;         // crossfade seconds
phase = (time - inPoint) % len;
start = inPoint;

a = valueAtTime(start + phase);
b = valueAtTime(start + ((phase+blend)%len));
w = smooth(phase, len-blend, len, 0, 1); // 0→1 at seam
linear(w,0,1,a,b)
```

**Use**: seamless ambient backgrounds, perpetual UI animations.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## 11) Layer-Local Clocks & Counters (text)
**What it does**  
Generates timestamps/frames without precomp gymnastics.

```js
fps = 24;
frames = Math.floor((time-inPoint)*fps);
("0000"+frames).slice(-4)
```

**Variant** (mm:ss):
```js
t = Math.max(0, time-inPoint);
m = Math.floor(t/60); s = Math.floor(t%60);
(m<10?"0":"")+m+":"+(s<10?"0":"")+s
```

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## 12) Time Warp on Command (freeze/unfreeze via checkbox)
**What it does**  
Freezes animation globally when a checkbox is enabled.

```js
freeze = thisComp.layer("CTRL").effect("Quantize to Beat")("Checkbox")>0;
t = freeze ? thisComp.layer("CTRL").effect("Loop Length (sec)")("Slider") : time; // reuse an existing slider as the freeze time
valueAtTime(t)
```

**Use**: design reviews (“pause everything here”), editorial timing, stills pull.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### 🔧 Troubleshooting
- **Loop pops** → ensure your first/last frames match or use the Glide-Through seam blend.  
- **Quantize drifts** → confirm BPM, subdivision, and `inPoint` alignment.  
- **Remap stutters** → avoid easing on Time Remap itself; ease the *Playhead* slider instead.  
- **Offsets misorder** → layer index changes will change timing; lock order or drive from names.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### 🧪 Practice Exercises
1) Build a 2-second icon loop using Section 4 and convert it to a 120-BPM, on-eighths quantized version.  
2) Create a marker-driven pop for three layers and offset them with the index method.  
3) Time-remap a precomp with a Playhead slider and add ping-pong behavior.  
4) Add a stepped (on-twos) look using Hold-Step Animator; toggle it with a checkbox.  
5) Use Glide-Through Cuts to make a seamless 5-second background loop.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### 🎬 Wrap-Up
Time control is composition control. With loops, offsets, quantization, and remapping in your toolkit, you can retime entire sequences non-destructively—keeping your projects editable, musical, and modular.

> 🪄 *Next:* **Utility & Automation** — helpers, templates, batch setups, and safety patterns that save hours in production.


────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


<a id="utility-and-automation"></a>
## ⚙️ Utility & Automation — Workflow Enhancements for Efficiency and Consistency
Utility and automation expressions are the quiet backbone of professional motion design. They don’t draw attention on screen, but they make entire projects faster, more predictable, and far easier to manage.  
From layer indexing and controller propagation to adaptive timing and project-wide variables, this section gives you the practical toolkit for turning After Effects into a semi-automated production environment.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### 🧭 Core Idea
Automation in After Effects isn’t just about scripting—it begins inside the comp, using expressions to create self-updating systems.  
These patterns reduce repetition, minimize manual fixes, and ensure everything updates automatically when the project changes.  

Key benefits:
- **Scalability:** duplicate complex setups safely—no broken links.  
- **Adaptability:** projects adjust when durations or resolutions change.  
- **Consistency:** shared controllers synchronize multiple comps or precomps.  
- **Error-proofing:** “smart” behaviors prevent user mistakes.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## 1) Global Variable Controller
**What it does**  
Centralizes key production values (colors, scale, timing) so changes propagate everywhere.  

**Setup:**  
Create a null named **GLOBAL_CTRL**. Add relevant controls:
- Color: Brand Color
- Slider: Master Scale
- Slider: Global Opacity
- Checkbox: Safe Mode

**Usage Example:**
```js
G = thisComp.layer("GLOBAL_CTRL");
col = G.effect("Brand Color")("Color");
scaleMult = G.effect("Master Scale")("Slider")/100;
opacityMult = G.effect("Global Opacity")("Slider")/100;
[value[0]*scaleMult, value[1]*scaleMult];
```

Now, changing one slider scales or recolors every connected element—instant brand-wide updates.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## 2) Responsive Comp Sizing
**What it does**  
Auto-centers and repositions elements when the comp size changes.

```js
[ thisComp.width/2, thisComp.height/2 ];
```

**Use:**  
Keep logos, end cards, or UI elements locked to center regardless of resolution (e.g., 1080p → 4K).

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## 3) Layer Auto-Naming
**What it does**  
Displays each layer’s index and name dynamically—handy for precomps or debugging.

**Apply to Text Layer → Source Text:**
```js
index + ". " + thisLayer.name
```

**Bonus:** Add color-coded naming by index for complex sequences.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## 4) Adaptive Durations (Dynamic Out Points)
**What it does**  
Automatically adjusts layer Out Point to match a controller or comp length.  

**On any layer’s Out Point (Alt/Option-click stopwatch):**
```js
C = thisComp.layer("CTRL");
L = C.effect("Loop Length (sec)")("Slider");
inPoint + L;
```

Now, changing the loop length updates all linked layers—no trimming required.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## 5) Auto-Stagger Layers by Index
**What it does**  
Offsets layers automatically in time for clean cascades or reveal animations.

```js
offset = (index-1)*thisComp.frameDuration*10;
value - offset;
```

Combine with motion blur and fade expressions for effortless wave reveals.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## 6) Master-Slave Property Linking
**What it does**  
Links selected properties between layers to maintain unified behavior.

Example — link Opacity of duplicates:
```js
thisComp.layer("MASTER").transform.opacity
```

Example — link color of shapes:
```js
thisComp.layer("MASTER").content("Rectangle 1").content("Fill 1").color
```

**Tip:** Group all master controllers in a single Null to simplify referencing.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## 7) Checkbox-Based Visibility Toggles
**What it does**  
Shows/hides specific layers globally.

```js
C=thisComp.layer("GLOBAL_CTRL");
on = C.effect("Safe Mode")("Checkbox")>0;
on ? value : 0;
```

**Use:**  
Turn guides, lights, or FX passes on/off with one click—great for presentation modes.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## 8) Auto-Index Referencing for Duplicates
**What it does**  
Makes each duplicated layer self-aware of its index for parameter changes.

```js
seedRandom(index,true);
delay = index*thisComp.frameDuration*5;
valueAtTime(time - delay);
```

**Use:**  
Layer repeats, chain reactions, or ripple effects.  
One expression drives unlimited duplicates—no extra keys.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## 9) Automated Lower Thirds & Title Systems
**What it does**  
Builds auto-updating text elements that react to content size.

**Text Layer → Source Text:**
```js
name = thisComp.layer("GLOBAL_CTRL").effect("Project Name")("Slider");
name;
```

**Shape Background → Size:**
```js
s = thisComp.layer("TEXT").sourceRectAtTime(time,false);
[s.width + 100, s.height + 40];
```

**Result:**  
Change text → background resizes automatically → animation remains intact.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## 10) Conditional Animation Control (failsafe expressions)
**What it does**  
Prevents animation from running if a required layer/control doesn’t exist.  

```js
try{
  C=thisComp.layer("CTRL");
  amp = C.effect("Amp")("Slider");
  value + amp*Math.sin(time*2*Math.PI);
}catch(e){
  value; // fallback safely
}
```

**Use:**  
Prevents expression errors on templates where users might delete controls.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## 11) Procedural Layer Selector
**What it does**  
Finds and drives other layers by name pattern—useful for bulk effects.

```js
found = null;
for (i=1; i<=thisComp.numLayers; i++){
  if (thisComp.layer(i).name.indexOf("Icon_") != -1){
    found = thisComp.layer(i);
    break;
  }
}
found != null ? found.transform.opacity : value;
```

**Use:**  
Targets first matching layer for global animation systems.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## 12) Render-State Automation (Preview vs. Final)
**What it does**  
Switches settings based on preview quality or a checkbox toggle.

```js
preview = thisComp.layer("GLOBAL_CTRL").effect("Safe Mode")("Checkbox")>0;
preview ? 50 : 100; // Opacity, Quality, etc.
```

**Use:**  
Disable heavy blurs, 3D shadows, or grain when working interactively, then re-enable for final render.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### 🧪 Practice Exercises
1) Build a **GLOBAL_CTRL** and link all major colors and scales.  
2) Create a **Safe Mode** toggle to hide FX and speed up previews.  
3) Link a logo’s scale and opacity to Master sliders for quick adjustments.  
4) Duplicate layers using Auto-Index referencing for ripple animation.  
5) Implement Conditional Animation to protect your template from user errors.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### 🔧 Troubleshooting
- **Expressions break on missing controllers:** wrap with `try{}` blocks for safety.  
- **Global controllers not updating:** check effect names (case-sensitive).  
- **Auto-sizing text jumps:** use `sourceRectAtTime()` inside smooth() for better interpolation.  
- **Preview sluggish:** disable live expressions when designing—toggle them back on for final render.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## 🧩 Project Management & Expression-Driven Workflow — Maintaining Logic Across Complex Systems
At the professional level, *organization isn’t cosmetic—it’s logical infrastructure.*  
Every controller, link, and reference inside an expression depends on predictable naming, comp hierarchy, and reusable design.  
This chapter shows how disciplined structure directly improves expression reliability, preset creation, and collaborative scalability.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### 🧭 Why Organization Matters to Expressions
Expressions are literal; one typo or renamed layer breaks a rig.  
Good project structure transforms fragile setups into portable systems:

| Problem | Organizational Fix | Result |
|----------|--------------------|---------|
| “Missing Layer” errors | Consistent naming & index safety wrappers | Expressions never break when duplicating comps |
| Lost controllers | Centralized CTRL layers in predictable locations | Easy pick-whips, simple global overrides |
| Rig drift across versions | Versioned folder structure & FFX presets | Rigs remain identical across projects |
| Slow collaboration | Modular comps & documented variables | Faster troubleshooting, reusable templates |

Organization = error prevention + time compression.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## 1) Expression-Safe Naming & Referencing
AE expressions resolve layer and effect names literally.

**Guidelines:**
- Prefix controller layers with `CTRL_` and effects with short codes:  
  `CTRL_GLOBAL`, `CTRL_COLOR`, `CTRL_TIME`.  
- Avoid spaces or special symbols in layer/effect names.  
- For dynamic systems, use index-independent logic:  
  ```js
  thisComp.layer("CTRL_GLOBAL")  // safer than index references
  ```
- When you *must* use index (e.g., batch duplicates), wrap with `try{}` blocks:
  ```js
  try{ thisComp.layer(index-1).transform.position; }catch(e){ value; }
  ```

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## 2) Folder Architecture That Serves Logic
A folder system isn’t about tidiness—it’s about **dependency mapping**.

```
/PROJECT_MASTER/
 ├─ _AEP/MASTER/           → contains expression-driven comps
 ├─ _ASSETS/               → referenced footage (relative paths only)
 ├─ _RIGS/                 → reusable FFX, JSON, and .jsxbin files
 ├─ _PRESETS/              → exported Expression Controls & FFX presets
 ├─ _DOCS/                 → Markdown readmes describing controller logic
 └─ _EXPORTS/
```

When you reopen a project months later, your expression network still works because every link points to a known, version-controlled location.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## 3) Expression-Aware Precomp Hierarchy
Each precomp performs one logical function in an expression chain:
```
MASTER_COMP
 ├─ ANIM_RIG_PRECOMP       → motion & physics
 ├─ LIGHT_COLOR_PRECOMP    → color & lighting expressions
 ├─ CAMERA_CTRL_PRECOMP    → shared camera rig expressions
 └─ OUTPUT_LOOK_PRECOMP    → global color / tone / LUT automation
```
This separation keeps variable scopes clear and makes debugging simple.  
If a property fails, you know exactly which precomp layer owns the logic.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## 4) Using FFX Presets to Deploy Expressions
**FFX (After Effects Preset) files** are one of the most powerful tools for scaling expression-driven systems.

### 🔧 How it helps
- Stores effects *and their expressions* as reusable modules.  
- Can be batch-applied to multiple layers with identical logic.  
- Maintains all pickwhipped connections within the same layer context.

### 💡 Workflow
1. Build your expression-based rig (e.g., bounce, color, camera controller).  
2. Select all effects → Animation > Save Animation Preset.  
3. Save into `/RIGS/FFX/`.  
4. Re-apply in any project or comp.  

**Tip:** name FFX files by function (`CTRL_Bounce.ffx`, `ColorRig_v02.ffx`) and keep a short README noting what controllers are required.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## 5) Linking FFX to Global Controllers
Expressions inside FFX files can look outward to project-level controllers if you standardize naming.

Example:
```js
thisComp.layer("CTRL_GLOBAL").effect("Master Speed")("Slider");
```
If every comp follows that naming convention, your presets stay plug-and-play.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## 6) Versioning for Logical Stability
Expressions evolve—so treat them like code.

**Recommended pattern:**
```
/RIGS/
 ├─ BounceRig_v01.ffx
 ├─ BounceRig_v02.ffx
 ├─ BounceRig_v03_EXPONENTIAL.ffx
```

Document what changed (variables, decay method, dependencies).  
Never overwrite working rigs; incremental versioning guarantees reproducibility.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## 7) Dynamic Variables & Global Flags
Establish universal flags for production states:
```js
GLOBAL = thisComp.layer("CTRL_GLOBAL");
preview = GLOBAL.effect("Preview Mode")("Checkbox")>0;
preview ? 0.5 : 1; // e.g., opacity or quality switch
```
Use one flag to control render quality across dozens of comps—no manual toggling.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## 8) Error Handling and Self-Diagnostics
Professional rigs anticipate failure.

```js
try{
  ctrl = thisComp.layer("CTRL_GLOBAL");
  val  = ctrl.effect("Master Speed")("Slider");
  val;
}catch(err){
  value; // fallback
}
```

You can even **report** errors to a text layer:
```js
try{ thisComp.layer("CTRL_GLOBAL"); "OK"; }
catch(e){ "Missing: CTRL_GLOBAL"; }
```
When used in templates, this instantly flags broken references.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## 9) Team Collaboration and Automation
For multi-artist environments:
- Store all `.ffx` and `.jsxbin` in a shared **/RIGS** directory.  
- Reference them via relative paths.  
- Document dependencies in a small JSON manifest:
```json
{
 "CTRL_GLOBAL": ["Master Speed","Brand Color"],
 "CAM_RIG": ["Zoom","Dolly","Focus Distance"]
}
```
Each artist imports the same rig, ensuring expression parity across scenes.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## 10) Render & Handoff Automation
Pair organizational rigor with automation:

- Use **Collect Files** before handoff to package assets and expression-linked controllers.  
- Include an `AUTO_SETUP.ffx` that rebuilds all controller layers.  
- For scripted pipelines, a `.jsxbin` can scan the project, create missing CTRL layers, and apply correct presets automatically.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### 🧪 Practice Exercises
1) Build a small project using a global controller and save its logic as an FFX preset.  
2) Duplicate comps using standardized naming and confirm expressions don’t break.  
3) Add error handling to three expressions and test template safety.  
4) Create a “Preview Mode” checkbox that halves all motion blur or quality values.  
5) Export your camera rig and re-import it via FFX to verify portability.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### 🔧 Troubleshooting
- **Preset fails to load expressions:** verify “Use relative file paths” in preferences; avoid illegal characters in effect names.  
- **Links break after duplication:** switch from index to name references.  
- **Performance lag:** consolidate heavy expressions into precomps; cache global values with variables at top.  
- **Render mismatch:** use GLOBAL flags for preview/final toggles.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
